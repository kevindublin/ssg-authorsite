San Diego Poetry Annual -- published by Garden Oak Press (http://gardenoakpress.com), William Harry Harding (http://sandiegopoetryannual.com/publisher), editor -- is part of the permanent collection of every college and university in our region.

The People’s Choice Poem Performance Award – All participants read/perform one poem under three minutes long. Audience members choose (by secret ballot) their favorite poem based on content and performance. Props, artwork, singing, music, dancing, all accompaniment is allowed and anything goes. Top poem performances (the poems that receive the most votes) win \$50. Audience members will be encouraged to hoot for their favorites and try to influence the rest of the audience.

Food, beer/wine, DJ, live music from local father-son string duo Jesse and Andrew Michael -- all thanks to museum curator and poet Michael Klam and the San Diego Arts Institute.
