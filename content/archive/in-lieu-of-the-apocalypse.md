I'd like to invite you to check out and consider "What makes a poetry film a poetry film?" It's a question that Erica Gross over at *Connotations Press: An Online Artifact *considers in the [December video poetry section](http://connotationpress.com/video-poetry/1662-the-third-form-with-erica-goss-december-2012 "What Makes a Poetry Film?"). She discusses the Zebra Poetry Film Festival that apparently happened in October in Berlin. She posted ten videos, but I'm only going to link to one. You'll have to go over there to see all ten.
