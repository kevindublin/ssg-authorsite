It's Summer 2019 in SF. Let's write at this free writing workshop! We'll talk a little about writing and work through a series of prompts based \*very broadly\* on summer, seasons and nature. As always, the idea is to write, so you can interpret the prompts however you like or ignore them completely. If interested, you'll have opportunity to share your work. This meeting is FREE and will be in San Francisco but is a few steps from BART.

Syzygy is about a block and a half from Powell Street Station and directly across the street from the bar Aunt Charlie's. The door will be black with an ajar gate in front of it. Press the doorbell to be let in.
