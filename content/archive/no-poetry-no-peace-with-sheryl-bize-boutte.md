**This event is produced in partnership with theÂ [San Francisco Writers Conference](http://www.sfwriters.org/).**

"Poetry provides pathways for creative and cathartic human expression and peace." Join us in celebration of National Poetry Month for a reading of poems from No Poetry No Peace, a collection written by Sheryl Bize-Boutte and her daughter Dr. Angela Boutte; and a selection of bay area poets: Isis Machline Blanchette, Leticia Garcia Bradford, Fred Dodsworth, Kevin Dublin, and Mary Mackey.
