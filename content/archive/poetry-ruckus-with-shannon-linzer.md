A monthly open mike event for local poets to share their work. Please join us and bring some poetry to read.

Doors open at 7 PM, open mic poetry begins at 7:30 (prepare to read anything of five minutes length or less and sign up with emcee Michael) and our guest takes the stage around 9 PM. Entry is FREE.

Wednesday 5/27/15, Ruthless Hippies proudly presents the Poetry Ruckus at Ducky Waddle’s (414 N Coast Hwy 101 Leucadia) featuring guest poet Shannon Linzer!!!

Shannon Linzer is a local San Diego poet whose work focuses on identity, privilege, queerness and religion. She is a regular in the San Diego open mic & slam scene, and has featured at Jhimye Poetry & Lyrical Exchange in North Park. Her work has been published in Spit Journal. When not writing, Shannon spends her time teaching all manner of things—English, exercise, handstands and cat tricks. Look for her daily haiku on facebook and her first short collection of poems, due out this summer.
