The Ruthless Hippies are at it again: the poetry and music group, who are “are motivated by fun, art for art’s sake, community and the possibility of a cleaner world,” are once again collaborating with Ducky Waddle’s for another night of Poetry Ruckus. Ted Washington will be the evening’s guest poet. Afterwards, attendees can sign up for the open mike roster and read some of their own stuff. It’s a great chance to perform, listen, and just enjoy a night with a community of artists.
