The Poetry Ruckus @ The Duck is a monthly poetry event that features local poets reading their work and always features a Special Guest Poet. If you would like to participate and be added to our performance roster, email Michael, ruthlesshippies\@gmail.com

There is no admission charge but we ask for a small donation to help offset our expenses.
