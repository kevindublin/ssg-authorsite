San Diego performance artists Chris Mosher, Shannon Perkins and musician Nathan Hubbard will present spoken word and music. People’s Choice Poem Awards follow the performances. This interactive arts and culture experience will include wine, snacks and plenty of time to mingle. Doors open at 6:30 p.m. and the show starts at 7 p.m. Members are free, nonmembers are \$5 at the door, or bring wine to share and get in free.

Chris Mosher started performing in 2002. Having grown up an artist and painter, he found his voice through a plethora of emerging vocalists, improvisers, and a small group of fellow rappers, musicians, and poets. Moving up and down the coast, recording and performing with friends and on his own, he has crafted a unique and lasting persona in both the spoken word and music scene.

Shannon Perkins began performing in 2000 and quickly found herself on the San Diego Poetry Slam team the following year. As a part of multiple groups including Able Minded Poets and currently Ogd\_s(11) Translation Has Failed, she has honed her craft as a performance poet. She has also shifted her attention toward visual art, featuring in galleries up and down the West Coast. Shannon was most recently featured on Ogd\_s(11)’s album Falling Too Slow.

Nathan Hubbard is one of San Diego’s busiest percussionists, leading several genre-pushing groups and collaborating with many of San Diego's finest. His five-volume album set, Encinitas and Everything After, was named Best Jazz Album at the San Diego Music Awards in October 2014.

DJ Gill Sotu will also provide music. Sotu has opened for Grammy-nominated Sheila E, and partnered and performed with the San Diego Symphony. He has been commissioned to create numerous poetry pieces for the United Way of San Diego and performed for TEDx San Diego in December 2013. Sotu has been featured on NBC 7’s Art Pulse TV and was named the 2012 & 2013 San Diego RAW Performing Artist of the Year.

The People’s Choice Poem Performance Award – All participants read/perform one poem under three minutes long. Audience members choose (by secret ballot) their favorite poem based on content and performance. Props, artwork, singing, music, dancing, all accompaniment is allowed and anything goes. Top poem performances (the poems that receive the most votes) win \$50. Audience members will be encouraged to hoot for their favorites and try to influence the rest of the audience.

Writers/artists who would like to participate in the People’s Choice Poem Performance Awards can get their names in the hat ahead of time at mkklam\@gmail.com or sign in on the night of the show.

There will be goodies and wine as always. Bring beverages or snacks/desserts/dishes to share and get in free. Please contact host Michael Klam with any questions: 619-957-3264 (cell) or 619-236-0011 (museum).
