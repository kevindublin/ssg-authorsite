My name is Kevin Dublin. I’m a part-time publisher and writer of poetry, prose, scripts, and code. I currently live in San Francisco, CA. I'm from North Carolina. I’m very interested in modern and contemporary poetry & poetics, hip-hop, film, service-learning, working with young artists, Python/Django, and all combinations of the aforementioned.

I spend most of my time reading, watching interesting narratives, and writing. I really enjoy people, especially those interested in writing, programming, or board games, and I would love to hear from you. Feel free to contact me!
