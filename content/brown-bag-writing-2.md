\$5 - Given prompts, the writer will practice any and all types of writing whether itâ€™s fiction, memoir, journaling, letter writing, poetry or any mental meanderings. Each meeting is simply a time and a place to get your pen moving across the page, letting it take you where it will, free from editing and critique.
