I've had about half of the poems from my series on Sylvia Plath, "Courting Sylvia Plath" published over in the literary journal [Menacing Hedge](http://menacinghedge.com/spring2015/entry-dublin.php). To celebrate, I've posted recordings of three of the poems to Soundcloud. You can listen to "At a Euro Cafe in East Village," "An Affair on Hampstead Heath," and "Fragments" from "Courting Sylvia Plath" below and follow along in the lit journal after reading a preface to the work.
