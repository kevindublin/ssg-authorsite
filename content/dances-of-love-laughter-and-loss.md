Jean Isaacs San Diego Theater will start the New Year by returning to the Weiss Theater on the UCSD campus for three days of dance.

Entitled "Dances of Love, Laughter, and Loss," Isaacs will revisit a work created in 2003 while presenting a World Premiere. Both works embrace text and utilize spoken word in collaboration with movement.

Cost: \$15 - \$50
