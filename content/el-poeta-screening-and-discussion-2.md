Join Latino Public Broadcasting and the Media Arts Center San Diego as we host a screening and discussion of the new PBS/VOCES documentary El Poeta.

The evening will begin with a hosted reception with beer donated by Karl Strauss, followed by a screening of the documentary and moderated audience Q&A. El Poeta tells the story of renowned Mexican poet Javier Sicilia, who ignited mass protests and an ongoing international movement after the brutal killing of his 24-year-old son Juan Francisco in 2011 -- collateral damage in a drug war that has left more than 100,000 dead or missing since 2006.
