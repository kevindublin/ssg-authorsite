**Especially living during this time of COVID-19,** isolation is a growing health epidemic, most pointedly among seniors who are affected by a complex of factors including a lack of access, health issues, and major life changes. Now in its fourth year, the Elder Project seeks to reduce isolation for seniors in underserved areas by bringing generative writing workshops to retirement communities across Oakland and San Francisco. Weâ€™ve expanded classes to Zoom online and opened them up to anyone 60+.
