Freedom Writers. 2007. 123 minutes. PG-13. An idealistic high school English teacher (Hillary Swank) quickly learns that her students have more to worry about than homework -- her students go home everyday to gunfire, gangs, drugs, and a host of other difficult situations.

She challenges her students to read The Diary of Anne Frank and Zlata's Diary: A Child's Life in Saravejo and to write in their own diaries about the violence, discrimination, and hatred that is part of their everyday lives. The film is based onThe Freedom Writers Diary, the 1999 non-fiction book written by students at Woodrow Wilson High School in Long Beach, California and their teacher Erin Gruwell.
