This coming Thursday, we will be featuring Yesika Salgado!

Once upon a time in Los Angeles, Yesika Salgado was born to Salvadorian immigrants. As a direct result of too many library visits, telenovelas and a large passionate family, she developed a torrid love affair with Poetry. She writes about many different things but always from the perspective of a fat brown girl loving and living in two cultures simultaneously.  
Yesika has shared her work at schools and venues throughout Southern California. In July of 2013 she published her first collection of poetry titled The Luna Poems and is a member of the 2014 Da Poetry Lounge Slam Team.

GM: What would you name the autobiography of your life?  
YS: Corazon. I’ve had the titled chosen for years. It means heart. It is also used the same way the word Darling is used in the English language. It’s what my father called my sisters and I. It is my favorite thing to be called.

GM: If you could dis-invent one thing, what would it be?  
YS: Guns. I’d settle for guns that belong to racist cops.

GM: What is your favorite movie line or scene?  
YS: My favorite movie scene has no dialogue. It is from the movie Amelie. The man she is in love with walks into the diner she works at. He sits down. She never musters up the courage to talk to him. When he gets up to leave she looks at him one last time and suddenly becomes a puddle of water. It is so beautiful. It is exactly how those kind of moments feel.

GM: What was the first thing you bought with your own money?  
YS: I bought a Nokia brick cell phone with my first paycheck and I played snake on it for hours.

GM: If you could bring someone famous back from the grave (not as a zombie), who would you choose?  
YS: Charles Bukowski aka Bae aka my beloved. If I could pick a second person it will be Selena. You know what, Selena wins over Bukowski. I pick Selena. That brown girl gave me life.

GM: If you could learn to do anything, what would it be?  
YS: How to spin straw into gold. Haha.
