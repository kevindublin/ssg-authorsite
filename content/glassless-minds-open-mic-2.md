Glassless Minds Open Mic night consists of a host, the audience, a DJ, the open mic performers and a featured visual artist. Our doors open at 6:30pm, at this time you can sign up to be a performer on our open mic list (Look for someone holding a clipboard). As the open mic begins we will call the names for the list in random order to come and rock our stage for 2 songs/poems OR 5 minutes (which ever comes first). Each event we showcase a visual artist that maybe selling prints, creating live art or speaking about their craft or all of the above! (http://www.glasslessminds.com/open-mic/)
