Sometimes all you need is a place and a time to dedicate to yourself. Join us at Words Alive for some quality you time.

Since 2009 So Say We All have hosted Greenroom Writing Workshops: free, open, generative creative writing workshops that provide writers of all experience levels a kind, supportive, and challenging community in which to meet, write, and better one another. All Greenrooms are structured around a topic and include periods for discussion, generative free-writing, and opportunities to share aloud.

This evening will give you a chance to test out some ideas for your next VAMP piece or your next novel.
