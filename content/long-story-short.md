Long Story Short (LSS) is a storytelling show in which anyone of any skill level can arrive and tell a 5-minute story, without notes, on a different theme each month. Free.

January 11th: At our December show, we had a drawing to pick that month's theme. The prize for the runner-up? They decided the January theme, which was \*drum roll\*...CHICKEN! Come tell stories of birds, cowards, dinners & more at our improv storytelling show.
