### Testimonials and Comments about Instruction

> “Kevin Dublin \[led\] a special event for National Poetry Day at my place of work. That experience has stuck with me, in the best of ways! It was a completely new experience and opportunity for creative expression. Kevin also set a tone of comfort and nurtured a safe place for us to share what he had led us to create.”
