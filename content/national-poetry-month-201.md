I'm going to attempt to blog each day of April with a poem from poets that I like following these Â themes:

\#ModernMonday

\#TedHughesTuesday

\#WomenPoetsWednesday

\#Pre-ModernThursday

\#CaveCanemFriday

\#InternationalSaturday

\#ElizabethBishopSunday

I'm hoping to have each blog contain an audio or visual element as well. Let's see if I can be dedicated. Follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/parteverything "Follow Me") to keep updated.
