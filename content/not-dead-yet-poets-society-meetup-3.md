Join us on Wednesdays for the (Not) Dead (Yet) Poet's Society, led by Anna DiMartino and Ron Salisbury. We will have a lively discussion on a contemporary piece of poetry, work from a writing prompt, writing for a short time (10-15 min.), and we'll read/critique participants' work (if they would like). Participants are encouraged to bring 10 copies of a work in progress, not to exceed 1 page.
