### Not Kissing You

 

As inconvenient as being

the mother of breeze—

How she must name

each breeze and remember it.

 

Which one stirs empty chip wrapper

saddling the curb near your sandal?

I rub my cheek to be less conscious of air

untidying the hair on my forearms.

 

But the slight stutter of your smile—

Glow of November dusk across brow

while trolley brakes against rails in the distance.

Your lips: a strawberry perfectly split open.
