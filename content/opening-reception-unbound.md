The San Diego Public Library is pleased to partner with the Athenaeum Music & Arts Library in the presentation of \[UN\]BOUND: Artists’ Books from the Athenaeum Music & Arts Library. In 25 years of collecting, the Athenaeum artists’ book collection has grown into an important resource for artists, researchers, and presses. While portions of the collection are continually displayed for visitors in the Athenaeum’s North Reading Room and are also available for use by appointment, this exhibition provides unprecedented access to over 50 books by 36 local artists.

The artists’ books featured often push the form, employ a wide assortment of materials and methods of bookbinding, and explore varied subjects from the personal to the public. Through the outstanding collection of the Athenaeum, \[UN\]BOUND offers a unique opportunity to discover the book as both object and idea in the hands of San Diego artists.

The exhibit is running until April 26.
