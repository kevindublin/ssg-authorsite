## Testimonials

> “Last year we had Kevin Dublin do a special event for National Poetry Day at my place of work. That experience has stuck with me, in the best of ways! It was a completely new experience and opportunity for creative expression. Kevin also set a tone of comfort and nurtured a safe place for us to share what he had led us to create.”

-Atlassian Team Member

> “I loved everything about the class and so grateful for the experience. It’s been profound for me and a new beginning.”

-Beginning Poetry Student

> “[The workshop] got me writing, was fun, sometimes difficult, a bit challenging. I had never written poetry before.”

-Writing Poetry Student

> “My poetry was fundamentally shaped by the ethos of your rhythm-based class, but I think I was unable to fully appreciate the breadth of what you taught until very recently.”

-Poetry for Page and Stage Student

> “It was such an inspiring experience for me and really opened my eyes to hip-hop’s poetic elements.”

-Hip-Hop Poetry Student

> “Thanks ad infinitum to Kevin Dublin & the Writing Salon. Yesterday’s generative writing workshop was A-1.”

-Generative Writing Workshop Student
