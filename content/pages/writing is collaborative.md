What is Writing is Collaborative? Well, Iâ€™m used to sending out e-mails to writing friends about upcoming opportunities. I decided to turn it into a brief newsletter. And I did it because writing is about community. For instance, I like being a conduit. I want to share things with all of you. This is why I now send upcoming submission deadlines, residency opportunities, events, classes, writing prompts, and spotlights as well as a few musings like video poems I watch and like.
