Free - In the tradition of the original Brown Bag group and Thursday Writers, San Diego Writers, Ink is pleased to offer this regularly scheduled drop-in group for writers in northern San Diego where all you have to do is show up and write.

No need to pre-register, just bring your notebook and join us for an hour of free-writing fun and writerly camaraderie.

We’ll supply the prompts, you do the writing–all with pen/pencil and paper. It’s fast, it’s fun and there’s no critique. But there are always surprises.

Hosted by Diane Malloy.
