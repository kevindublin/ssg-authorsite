The People’s Choice Poem Performance Award – All participants read/perform one poem under three minutes long. Audience members choose (by secret ballot) their favorite poem based on content and performance. Props, artwork, singing, music, dancing, all accompaniment is allowed and anything goes. Top poem performances (the poems that receive the most votes) win \$50. Audience members will be encouraged to hoot for their favorites and try to influence the rest of the audience.

Writers/artists who would like to participate in the People’s Choice Poem Performance Awards can get their names in the hat ahead of time at mkklam\@gmail.com or sign in on the night of the show.

There will be goodies and wine as always. Bring beverages or snacks/desserts/dishes to share and get in free. Please contact host Michael Klam with any questions: 619-957-3264 (cell) or 619-236-0011 (museum).
