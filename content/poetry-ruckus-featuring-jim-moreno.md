Hey poetry fans, we’ve got a treat for you coming up next Wednesday (1/21/15) at Ducky Waddle’s Emporium (414 N Coast Hwy 101). The one and only Jim Moreno will be guest reading at the Poetry Ruckus on the night of his 67th birthday!

Jim is a dynamic poet whose revolutionary verse calls for action and social justice. Transcending politics, his poetry comes from the heart and yearns for a more humane society. This will be his second guest appearance at the Ruckus.

Also, Jim Moreno is on the Advisory Board of the Poetic Medicine Institute of Palo Alto, California and a Regional Editor of the San Diego Poetry Annual. He is a Teaching Artist with Young Audiences of San Diego and the Point Loma Arts Academy. Jim is the Resident Poet for the Juvenile Court & Community Schools and was an original member of the Langston Hughes Poetry Circle. Moreno is the author of “Dancing In Dissent”, (Dolphin Calling Press, 2007) and two cd’s of music and poetry. He hosts “2nd Tuesday— Jihmye Poetry” at the Cafe Cabaret on Adams Ave., and is in post production for his radio show “The Poetry Cafe” to be aired on KNSJ, 89.1 FM & KNSJ.org.

So come check it out people! Let’s make this a great birthday party for an awesome local poet who gives much the community through his words and efforts. The doors open at 7, open poetry starts 7:30 and Jim takes the stage at 9 PM.
