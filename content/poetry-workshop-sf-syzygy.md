Come to this Generative Poetry Workshop in SF led by Kevin Dublin to go through a series of short prompts. We’ll generate new drafts and set the groundwork for how you can continue working on your poems. This class is for you whether you’ve never picked up a pencil before or you’re an accomplished writer with awards, and especially for everyone else in between.
