I will be on a panel with two lovely and brilliant writers (Christopher Pendergraft and Dillon Scalzo) at the University of Southern California's Cruelty conference in Los Angeles, CAÂ on April 12-13, 2013. We're hosting a creative panel featuring readings, a discussion, and Q&A. Here's a copy of the [proposal](http://www.kevindublin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panel_proposal1.pdf). Hope to see you there!
