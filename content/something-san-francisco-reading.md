I'm lucky enough to join as one of the featured readers at a crossover event with one of my favorite new magazines, [The SanFranciscan](https://thesanfranciscanmagazine.com/) & one of my favorite new reading series, [Something Ordinary](https://www.instagram.com/somethingordinary_/).Â  It's a virtual event to kickoff the soon to be released third issue of The SanFranciscan, so you can join via Zoom.
