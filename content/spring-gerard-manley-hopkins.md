Nothing is so beautiful as Spring ——  
   When weeds, in wheels, shoot long and lovely and lush;  
   Thrush’s eggs look little low heavens, and thrush  
Through the echoing timber does so rinse and wring  
The ear, it strikes like lightnings to hear him sing;  
   The glassy peartree leaves and blooms, they brush  
   The descending blue; that blue is all in a rush  
With richness; the racing lambs too have fair their fling.

What is all this juice and all this joy?  
   A strain of the earth’s sweet being in the beginning  
In Eden garden. – Have, get, before it cloy,

   Before it cloud, Christ, lord, and sour with sinning,  
Innocent mind and Mayday in girl and boy,  
   Most, O maid’s child, thy choice and worthy the winning.

[\#Modern Monday](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/browse/poets#school-period=13 "Who are they?") [\#National Poetry Month](http://www.poets.org/page.php/prmID/41 "What is it?")

So [Gerard Manley Hopkins](http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/284 "More on Hopkins") might teckevinally be considered a late Victorian poet, but formally he was so innovative that Ramazani, editor of (the amazing) [Norton Anthology of Modern and Contemporary Poetry](http://www.amazon.com/Norton-Anthology-Modern-Contemporary-Poetry/dp/0393977919/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1364875505&sr=8-1&keywords=Norton+Anthology+of+Modern+and+Contemporary+Poetry "When will there be a Kindle version?") included him as a Modernist. I'd definitely agree, especially since his sprung rhythm, alliteration, and rhyming is more similar to rap lyrics than poetry. It's like Rakim said on his track "[Follow the Leader](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkTUJ6FnFFQ "Listen"):"

> RAP is Rhythm And Poetry, cuts create sound effects /  
> You might catch up if you follow the records he wrecks /  
> Until then keep eating and swallowing /  
> You better take a deep breath and keep following-- the leader. /

Rakim was just following Hopkins' tradition, and so are all the rappers (nearly every contemporary rapper) who followed him.
