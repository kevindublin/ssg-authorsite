##### SF Writing Class in the Richmond

This is a 6 hour seminar / one day multi-genre class.  
Cost: There is a fee for this class, between \$134-145. See the Writing Salon website for details. Great for fiction, poetry, memoir writers, and more.

Sometimes if we've never written before or if we haven't written in a while, we wonder if we're really writers. Instructor Kevin Dublin says, â€œWriters write, simple as that. In this one-day workshop, my goal is for you to tap into the writing mind, to fill it up with your stories, your words."

We're going to write a lot based on multiple prompts, interactive activities and powerful exercises. For inspiration and guidance, we'll look at work by Mary Oliver, Khaled Hosseini, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Alfred Hitchcock. This class is open to all genres, even if you're not sure what you want to write yet.

We'll also cover several techniques to continue your writing practice after class ends. Kevin says, "This workshop is for those who are just beginning their writing journey, advanced writers who want a fresh kickstart to their writing life, and everyone in between!"
