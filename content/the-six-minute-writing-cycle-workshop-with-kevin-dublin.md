**The Six Minute Writing Cycle Workshop**  
with Kevin Dublin

We're going to read a few example pieces, then cycle through writing prompts and exercises to generate new writing, "self-workshop" with a set of specific questions, and revise your piece all in six minute cycles in order to learn how to create a strong draft of writing in less than twenty minutes. If you come ready to improvise, experience, question, and be vulnerable with yourself, then you'll leave this workshop with a new piece that you're excited about. This workshop is open to all genres, even if you're not sure what you want to write yet.

**The Writers Montage Workshop**, hosted by [Defunkt Magazine](http://defunktmag.com/), brings 4 different experiences with writing and 4 different writers (Patricia Coral, Raquel Abend van Dalen, Kevin Dublin, Dillon Scalzo) to lead sections of a one day, 4 hour workshop. *The Six Minute Writing Cycle Workshop*, led by Kevin Dublin, will be a 50 minute segment of this mosaic style workshop.
