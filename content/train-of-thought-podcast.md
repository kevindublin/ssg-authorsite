Train of Thought Podcast is a living room style podcast where we interview artists, musicians, poets, entrepreneurs and other passionate people about how they navigate the five components of a balanced life: Relationships, Career, Health, Finance, & Community.

Our aim is focused on but is not limited to the minority community; what inspires us, what are our obstacles, and who can we emulate to achieve our dreams. Humorous, thought provoking, informative and often down right ridiculous, Train of Thought will soon be, if not already, your favorite podcast!
