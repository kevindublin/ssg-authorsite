Two poems I wrote were just published alongside some fantastic poetry, prose, and art in the latest issue of *[Glint Literary Journal](https://glintjournal.wordpress.com/issue-6-fall-2015/poetry-glint-6/kevin-dublin-glint-6/)*.  The aural quality of a work is always important to me. Here is a recording of me reciting the poem. Listen if you have some time, then head over to read the other poem and the [whole issue](https://glintjournal.wordpress.com/issue-6-fall-2015/).
