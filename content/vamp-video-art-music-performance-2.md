THIS WEEK  
VAMP: Parasites  
http://www.sosayweallonline.com/event/vamp-parasites-3/

Symbiosis can be a beautiful thing. Until it’s not. The flora and fauna of our blood and guts (and colons), our interpersonal relationships, and our cubicle mates all walk a delicate balance between helpfulness and sucking the life right out of us. Come join us for stories of parasites both microscopic and human-sized! It might not be THE grossest show we’ve ever done, but it’ll probably come close.

Featuring:  
Anastasia Zadeik  
Craig Oliver  
Edward Deull  
Esther Woodman  
Lauren Cusick  
Leo Dekelbaum  
Sarah Mo

Join us for stories of parasites both microscopic and human-sized. If it isn't be the grossest show we’ve ever done, it’ll come close. \$5 suggested donation.

VAMP (Video, Art, Music, Performance) is a highly produced multimedia variety showcase, presenting artists and their workshopped material in a polished monthly show. All participants are chosen by blind online submission, all pieces are given a free workshop to further improve the material, and then the final product is curated in a featured capacity.
