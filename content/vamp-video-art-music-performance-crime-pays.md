THIS WEEK  
VAMP: Crime Pays

It only takes one look at the earnings portfolio of JP Morgan Chase to realize that maybe everything we were taught about crime not paying wasn’t entirely grounded in facts. Join So Say We All’s VAMP Storytelling Showcase this January for a night of stories about getting away with it, the score that went right, and more surprising tales from the less-than-legal economy.
