Bridal party hook-ups, awkward bachelor parties, and that time drunk Uncle Steve gave a 20 minute toast, you name it. Wedding Season is upon us, and come join us for some relief from the tulle and string quartets as we regale you with our finest and cringe-worthiest stories of state-sanctioned romance.

VAMP (Video, Art, Music, Performance) is a highly produced multimedia variety showcase, presenting artists and their workshopped material in a polished monthly show. All participants are chosen by blind online submission, all pieces are given a free workshop to further improve the material, and then the final product is curated in a featured capacity.
