VAMP (Video, Art, Music, Performance) is a highly produced multimedia variety showcase, presenting artists and their workshopped material in a polished monthly show. All participants are chosen by blind online submission, all pieces are given a free workshop to further improve the material, and then the final product is curated in a featured capacity.
