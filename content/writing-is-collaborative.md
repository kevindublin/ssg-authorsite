Writing is Collaborative Newsletter

The second "Writing is Collaborative" newsletter went out today. What is that? Well, I'm used to sending out e-mails to writing friends about upcoming opportunities. I decided to turn it into a brief newsletter. And I did it because writing is about community. For instance, I like being a conduit. I want to share things with all of you. This is why I now send upcoming submission deadlines, residency opportunities, events, classes, writing prompts, and spotlights. You can subscribe below:

You can expect to find a lot of content and maybe a few musings. For example, I include a "video poem of the month." It's also specifically for writers, so I include a writing prompt. While it might be pretty poetry heave because I encounter a lot of poetry opportunities, it won't all be. I've included poetry, fiction, creative non-fiction, and playwriting opportunities thus far. I'll start including screenwriting and review opportunities in the next one. I also have friends from all kinds of backgrounds and in many locations, so everything might not apply to everyone. I included an opportunity that was only for Native Americans in the first one as well as some opportunities just for women, and others that have been for the LGBTQIA+ community. Of course, young and emerging writers are groups that I work with, so I'll include more of those in the future.

It's a fun project! Send me your news, calls for submissions, and publications as well. I'd love to share!
