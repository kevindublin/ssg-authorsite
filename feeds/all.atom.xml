&lt;h3&gt;Now Playtesting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s 2419. The planet of Olorun is a powerful, wealthy, and collectivist independent world nation.  The Galactic Federation has extended an invitation to Olorun to join the empire. Some Olorunians assume they want the planet’s rich natural resources to restore their glory. Others believe they should join the Galactic Federation and reform it to create a better galaxy. As Vice Admirals re-enter the lunar space near their planet, they learn that Federation forces have secretly established automated tactical defense outposts on each of their seven moons while they were in negotiations. Several Vice Admirals have command of fleets of 8 ships in charge of neutralizing these outposts. Careful! The outposts, while still in early stages, have powerful armaments. There are also rumors of Federation sympathizers among Olorunians who helped establish the  outposts for their own purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Battle for the consciousness of planet Olorun in solo, cooperative, or competitive play in this Afro-futurist space board game for 1–4 players. Answer the question: “Are we responsible for all of our people or all people when the universe is filled with those who care only for themselves?”&lt;/p&gt;

"Just like physical training, increasing our writing strength requires practice. Often, the more words put to page, the easier it becomes to put more there."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Writing Salon Monthly Meetup is designed to provide an intentional and facilitated space to help you keep a finger on your own creative pulse. At the same time, we provide the opportunity to engage with a community of other like-minded writers, including your own friends, neighbors, co-workers, and family members. Bringing a guest is encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silence your phone, leave your distractions at the door, and spend an hour and a half of your Sunday with The Writing Salon. Kevin will provide optional writing prompts and exercises, pre-writing activities, and more! Expect a fun and stress-free environment to play on the page and to mingle with other writers. The event is free, but donations are greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="archive"></category></entry><entry><title>Intro to Creative Writing in Berkeley @ Writing Salon</title><link href="https://kevindublin.com/intro-creative-writing-berkeley.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-08-30T10:14:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-08-30T10:14:00-07:00</updated><author><name>kevin</name></author><id>tag:kevindublin.com,2019-08-30:/intro-creative-writing-berkeley.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h4&gt;Intro to Creative Writing in Berkeley Class Description&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Everyone has a story, and every story is made up of other stories that can be told. So how will you tell your story? And to whom?" asks instructor &lt;a href="http://kevindublin.com/bio/"&gt;Kevin Dublin&lt;/a&gt; of the Berkeley creative writing class at the Writing Salon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a (5) week workshop that covers fiction, poetry, personal essay, and screenwriting. We will generate ideas and writing through a series of fun exercises. In class, we will build memorable scenes, create vivid images, hook with narration, craft characters, and develop engaging dialogue. A range of creative work from masters will guide us. Therefore, the work of Lydia Davis, Julio Cortazar, Morgan Parker, Matsuo Bashō, and Franz Kafka will make appearances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin says, "One key component of writing is finding people to talk with about writing who are as passionate as you are or would like to be. We'll provide a space for that."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though always optional,  there will be take-home exercises and opportunities to share your work with one another during class. By the end of five weeks, you’ll have the tools and confidence to write that poem, essay or story that’s all your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kevin Dublin [led] a special event for National Poetry Day at my place of work. That experience has stuck with me, in the best of ways! It was a completely new experience and opportunity for creative expression. Kevin also set a tone of comfort and nurtured a safe place for us to share what he had led us to create.”&lt;/p&gt;

I decided to turn it into a brief newsletter. And I did it because writing is about community. For instance, I like being a conduit. I want to share things with all of you. This is why I now send upcoming submission deadlines, residency opportunities, events, classes, writing prompts, and spotlights. You can subscribe below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can expect to find a lot of content and maybe a few musings. For example, I include a "video poem of the month." It's also specifically for writers, so I include a writing prompt. While it might be pretty poetry heave because I encounter a lot of poetry opportunities, it won't all be. I've included poetry, fiction, creative non-fiction, and playwriting opportunities thus far. I'll start including screenwriting and review opportunities in the next one. I also have friends from all kinds of backgrounds and in many locations, so everything might not apply to everyone. I included an opportunity that was only for Native Americans in the first one as well as some opportunities just for women, and others that have been for the LGBTQIA+ community. Of course, young and emerging writers are groups that I work with, so I'll include more of those in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a fun project! Send me your news, calls for submissions, and publications as well.

&lt;h4&gt;What&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marvel versus DC is an unlicensed 2 - 4 player game that I created with my son, Darien Dublin, in the summer of 2014.  One of my favorite board games is Star Wars: Epic Duels. He really wanted to play with me, but he was six years old. Each character has a deck of 40 cards in that game. He could read, but it was a little to advanced for him. My goal was to make a game with him that he could play an utilized one of our favorite shared interests: superheroes. Who doesn't want to see those heroes battle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e8K1m6SCRz4" width="1349" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;How&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took the base mechanics of Star Wars: Epic Duels as inspiration and simplified the mechanics for the Marvel versus DC game. We had six 2.5 inch DC  PVC figures from Dollar Tree that we had been playing with. We had my childhood Marvel die-cast collection from the "Steel Mutants" and "Heavy Metal Heroes" series of the 90's. The only other things we had were our imaginations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3284/star-wars-epic-duels"&gt;&lt;img alt="star-wars-epic-duels" class="aligncenter wp-image-100682 size-full" height="600" src="http://kevindublin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Epic-Duels.jpg" width="896"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Over the course of the weekend, I wrote a series of rules. He picked who the first ten characters would be, and we discussed which powers should be showcased in their cards. We also watched old episodes of Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes on Netflix. After some math that I no longer remember, I came up with the size of the board, drew a set of squares for a map in Photoshop, and we had our first game board after a lot of printing &amp;amp; cutting &amp;amp; taping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't own these characters, nor the art used for the cards, but we worked really hard on the mechanics. My dream is to use the mechanics along with a set of original characters that we create and develop our own Heroes versus Villains universe in a game. Until then, we thought you might enjoy downloading and playing along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Marvel versus DC game has grown a lot. We have balanced and re-balanced it. It has brought a lot of joy. We've shared it with family, friends, and strangers at game shops / comic-cons. In other words, give it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Where to Buy Figures&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have (50) characters now. We teckevinally have more figures, but I decided to stop there because that already seemed like too many. Start low, with 6 - 10 characters and build from there. We use figures that are between 2.5 inches to 3 inches. You can probably go to Dollar Tree and buy the Justice League figures there: Batman, Flash, Green Lantern, and Superman along with the Joker. You can find others on Amazon, eBay, comic book stores and booths at conventions. If you don't mind the size, you can also buy Nano MetalFigs at your local Wal-Mart. They are about 1.5 inches and the game wasn't made with those in mind. &lt;a href="https://www.monogramdirect.com/products-by-license/dc-comics/diorama-figures/diorama-figures.html"&gt;Monogram International&lt;/a&gt; produced a lot of the 2.75 inch DC figures. Tips: search with the keywords "cake topper," "pvc 2.75," and "die cast 90s Marvel."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007EYK1DG?"&gt;Thor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

The concepts for my next few creative endeavors started to develop. Several previous creative projects came into the world. I thought the end of the first month of the new year would be a good time to reflect and look forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest creative culmination of 2017 for me was the publication of my first chapbook, &lt;a href="http://kevindublin.com/product/fall-in-love-in-san-diego/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Fall in Love in San Diego&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I'm so grateful for the to see that selection of poems under the eyes of readers. Working with the editors was a wonderful experience. I got to collaborate on its production and design the cover.They also let me put out the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Fall-Love-San-Diego-ebook/dp/B076PG7V6V/"&gt;ebook version&lt;/a&gt; myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Fall&lt;/em&gt; led me to creating video poems for several of the poems in the chapbook. I was lucky enough to have one of them featured in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://movingpoems.com/2017/03/not-kissing-you-by-kevin-dublin/"&gt;Moving Poems Magazine&lt;/a&gt;. A&lt;/em&gt;nother was featured at &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://poetryfilmlive.com/how-can-you-remain-in-love-in-san-diego/"&gt;Poetry Film Live&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Two of my favorite places to watch poetry films. I highly recommend added both to your feed. &lt;a href="https://davebonta.com/"&gt;Dave Bonta&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Moving Poems&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://elephantsfootprint.com/"&gt;Chaucer Cameron &amp;amp; Helen Dewbery&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Poetry Film&lt;/em&gt; have such amazing selections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also interviewed by &lt;a href="https://www.williamwoolfitt.com/"&gt;William Woolfitt&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://spkofmarvels.wordpress.com/2017/11/03/kevin-dublin"&gt;Speaking of Marvels&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;A website I've followed for the last several years. It was surreal to see my photo and my words on a feed that I frequently visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What might've been the coolest is actually being featured on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://itslitwithphdj.wordpress.com/2017/11/19/11-22-17-show-notes-feat-kevin-dublin/"&gt;It's Lit with PhDJ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;hosted by the gracious &lt;a href="https://anjoliroy.com/"&gt;Anjoli Roy&lt;/a&gt; in Honolulu on KTUH 90.1 FM. Getting to read my poems in the context of some of my favorite relevant music brought my childhood dreams of being a radio DJ briefly into fruition. You can listen to just the &lt;a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/anjoli-roy/kevin-dublins-mixdown-for-its-lit/"&gt;mixdown here&lt;/a&gt; or the whole radio show below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

I was also able to read poems from my chapbook as part of the [Tenderlovin’ in the Tenderloin Reading Series](https://www.tenderlovin.org/) &amp; Medium-Sized Living Room Concert in San Francisco as well as joining a few dates on the west coast tour of [The Poetry Brothel](http://www.thepoetrybrothel.com/events.html) as Mercury Hughes.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;In 2018&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's true that 2018 and beyond is looking great as well. I'll also be joining the brothel this spring, so join me in San Diego, San Francisco, or Oakland. I'm helping teach poetry classes as part of The Litquake Elder Project. We're teaching at the San Francisco Jewish Home at the moment. It's super rewarding. I start to forget it's one of my favorite things when I go too long without teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm working on a few more film poems right now. A talk featuring the above mentioned poetry filmmakers on film poetry inspired me to shoot a few as the beginning of the writer process. I've included it below.  I'm writing another draft of Termination Inc. as a one hour drama spec. The outline for an immersive theater experience that centers on empathy is on the way. I'm planning to teach an online class this year as well. I want to make it a way to teach more regularly in 2018 and beyond. &lt;a href="http://etchedpress.com"&gt;Etched Press&lt;/a&gt; is also poised for a return. I've accepted several really great manuscripts. Keep an eye out in the next month for more information!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Fall in Love in San Diego (&lt;/em&gt;Finishing Line Press, June 2017&lt;em&gt;) &lt;/em&gt;is a chapbook of 26 love &amp;amp; anti-love poems. The poems live inside, around, and far outside the bounds of San Diego, CA. They serve as a collective attempt to encapsulate the city’s energy and people as well as the universal, sometimes heart-wrenching 21st century search for love or something similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Reviews&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kevin Dublin is a new poet whose open-hearted songs of praise remind me of Whitman, O’Hara, and Ross Gay. &lt;em&gt;How to Fall in Love in San Diego&lt;/em&gt; is a collection of remarkable formal variety, encompassing received forms, nonce forms, and what feels like a truly original improvisatory style with grace and confidence. It is also a collection of tonal and even spiritual variety. It can be as giddy and inclusive as one of the &lt;em&gt;Lunch Poems&lt;/em&gt;, as forcefully engaged with the world as &lt;em&gt;Citizen&lt;/em&gt;, or as transcendent and magisterial as Wordsworth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;even as the world beyond ashes and burns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May we wake each morning and remember it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to more from this wonderful poet. In &lt;em&gt;How to Fall in Love in San Diego&lt;/em&gt;, Dublin develops a redemptive art that charms even as it restores us to our own better selves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href="http://www.michaelwhitepoet.com/"&gt;Michael White&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;em&gt;Travels in Vermeer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kevin Dublin’s &lt;em&gt;How to Fall in Love in San Diego&lt;/em&gt; is synaptic, prowling dangerous borderlands between our nearly inarticulate sorrows and the ineffable.  These poems commune with desire and desertion, limn betrayal and tally up the damage.  The epiphanies are nearly numinous: “&lt;em&gt;Goodbye &lt;/em&gt;reminds me / to &lt;em&gt;mean what you put your mouth on&lt;/em&gt; / whether it’s words or the silent parts of a body.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.connotationpress.com/hoppenthaler-s-congeries"&gt;John Hoppenthaler&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;em&gt;Domestic Garden&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Dublin’s debut has some of the most beautiful love poems I have read this year, which is to say these are poems of heart-break and the knowledge that comes after, poems of play and the excitement that comes with, poems of surprise and the astonishment that stays. “Pretend you are here / for a wedding” the poet tells us, “—unless you are here for a wedding.” There is so much fun in these pages that you know pain is real. There is so much feeling in the images, in the tonalities, in the sexiness of warning (“that attraction transcends most sanity”), in lips (“each a strawberry perfectly split open”), in silences (“when a lover sleep-rhymes words that don’t rhyme”), in dreams (“that teach carousels are the best place for orgasms”). Beware. These poems bewitch. You might just fall in love.&lt;/p&gt;

Give the bartender a large tip&lt;br&gt;
and advice that changes her life.&lt;br&gt;
Flirt with a Swedish accent.&lt;br&gt;
Pretend you’re here&lt;br&gt;
for a wedding&lt;br&gt;
—unless you’re here&lt;br&gt;
for a wedding&lt;br&gt;
—then pretend you’re here&lt;br&gt;
post-divorce.&lt;br&gt;
Whisper in a cute brunette’s ear&lt;br&gt;
that her girlfriend is gorgeous,&lt;br&gt;
but hug the doorman.&lt;br&gt;
Learn his name&lt;br&gt;
the way Goldilocks&lt;br&gt;
tastes porridge—gingerly.&lt;br&gt;
Tap three strangers and&lt;br&gt;
ask for the restroom&lt;br&gt;
in a foreign tongue&lt;br&gt;
from perdon,&lt;br&gt;
dónde está el baño?&lt;br&gt;
to have you seen the loo?&lt;br&gt;
Be a noble experiment.&lt;br&gt;
Tell all hostesses Liam sent you.&lt;br&gt;
Ask why they don’t know him.&lt;br&gt;
Text any number in your phone&lt;br&gt;
and change the name to Liam.&lt;br&gt;
Get addresses of the cutest women&lt;br&gt;
and never visit them.&lt;br&gt;
Snag the Uber app.&lt;br&gt;
Ask where the drivers’&lt;br&gt;
pink mustache are.&lt;br&gt;
Tell them you heard&lt;br&gt;
Hillcrest was fun, but&lt;br&gt;
you’d rather drive&lt;br&gt;
to an apartment—&lt;br&gt;
any apartment they have keys to.&lt;br&gt;
Stir gasps in distant rooms,&lt;br&gt;
through every land, on each tongue&lt;br&gt;
Heed cabbies’ command:&lt;br&gt;
Make me forget&lt;br&gt;
we swoon in a desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tinder Profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not a good lover; although, I suggest it&lt;br&gt;
in every love poem is the absence&lt;br&gt;
of a black man face down on pavement:&lt;br&gt;
pimple on his left cheek grazed to hot pink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Can You Remain in Love in San Diego?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the screen froze when End Call was pressed.&lt;br&gt;
No feedback, just the illick between fingertip and glass.&lt;br&gt;
We always said goodbye too soon: before a question,&lt;br&gt;
before a &lt;em&gt;right quick&lt;/em&gt;, before &lt;em&gt;I love you&lt;/em&gt;. Today,&lt;br&gt;
like chill of shadow stroking cheek, was only goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sat—right in the grass. Where the hours pulled&lt;br&gt;
themselves onto my lap and asked to be cradled.&lt;br&gt;
Silent as the oval of my mouth when you said&lt;br&gt;
you wanted to be pregnant at a car dealership&lt;br&gt;
during an argument about curly fries &amp;amp; condiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will become of our children? They will suffer&lt;br&gt;
the rough edge of tenderness from another father,&lt;br&gt;
another mother. Your goodbye is an earthquake.&lt;br&gt;
The rest of life aftershocks at the realization: we were&lt;br&gt;
tectonic &amp;amp; unaware with no promise of tremors’ stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am afraid you will remember me as a wooden ladder&lt;br&gt;
or even worse, forget I was. And I’ll remember you&lt;br&gt;
as a disaster. Unable to recall how you swallowed yawns&lt;br&gt;
like milk, the attractiveness of how slow you’d waddle—&lt;br&gt;
so slow I’d miss your step—dust collected on magenta toes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we met, we were incredibly far from the desert.&lt;br&gt;
I thought you were too good for me. I didn’t think&lt;br&gt;
you’d speak. You said there’s a delay in my handsomeness.&lt;br&gt;
The &lt;em&gt;ness&lt;/em&gt; unsteadily climbed from your tongue to lips.&lt;br&gt;
I watched it fog, pillow in the air—brace a snowflake’s fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Fall in Love in San Diego&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple cuddles tongues on the corner of 5th and Market&lt;br&gt;
Their meeting shades sunrays that heat the rain puddle&lt;br&gt;
A man waits to wash his hands in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not Kissing You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As inconvenient as being&lt;br&gt;
the mother of breeze—&lt;br&gt;
How she must name&lt;br&gt;
each breeze and remember it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which one stirs empty chip wrapper&lt;br&gt;
saddling the curb near your sandal?&lt;br&gt;
I rub my cheek to be less conscious of air&lt;br&gt;
untidying the hair on my forearms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the slight stutter of your smile—&lt;br&gt;
Glow of November dusk across brow&lt;br&gt;
while trolley brakes against rails in the distance.&lt;br&gt;
Your lips: a strawberry perfectly split open.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Not Kissing You - Video Poem</title><link href="https://kevindublin.com/not-kissing-you-video-poem.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-01-23T00:39:00-08:00</published><updated>2017-01-23T00:39:00-08:00</updated><author><name>kevin</name></author><id>tag:kevindublin.com,2017-01-23:/not-kissing-you-video-poem.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"Not Kissing You" is a poem from &lt;a href="http://kevindublin.com/publications/how-to-fall/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Fall in Love in San Diego&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which debuts May 5, 2017.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise for &lt;em&gt;How to Fall in Love in San Diego&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kevin Dublin is a new poet whose open-hearted songs of praise remind me of Whitman, O’Hara, and Ross Gay. &lt;em&gt;How to Fall in Love in San Diego&lt;/em&gt; is a collection of remarkable formal variety, encompassing received forms, nonce forms, and what feels like a truly original improvisatory style with grace and confidence. It is also a collection of tonal and even spiritual variety: it can be as giddy and inclusive as one of the &lt;em&gt;Lunch Poems&lt;/em&gt;, as forcefully engaged with the world as &lt;em&gt;Citizen&lt;/em&gt;, or as transcendent and magisterial as Wordsworth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;even as the world beyond ashes and burns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May we wake each morning and remember it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to more from this wonderful poet. In &lt;em&gt;How to Fall in Love in San Diego&lt;/em&gt;, Dublin develops a redemptive art that charms even as it restores us to our own better selves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--&lt;a href="http://www.michaelwhitepoet.com/"&gt;Michael White&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;em&gt;Travels in Vermeer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kevin Dublin’s &lt;em&gt;How to Fall in Love in San Diego&lt;/em&gt; is synaptic, prowling dangerous borderlands between our nearly inarticulate sorrows and the ineffable.  These poems commune with desire and desertion, limn betrayal and tally up the damage.  The epiphanies are nearly numinous: “&lt;em&gt;Goodbye &lt;/em&gt;reminds me / to &lt;em&gt;mean what you put your mouth on&lt;/em&gt; / whether it’s words or the silent parts of a body.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--&lt;a href="https://www.connotationpress.com/hoppenthaler-s-congeries"&gt;John Hoppenthaler&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;em&gt;Domestic Garden&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Dublin’s debut has some of the most beautiful love poems I have read this year, which is to say these are poems of heart-break and the knowledge that comes after, poems of play and the excitement that comes with, poems of surprise and the astonishment that stays. “Pretend you are here / for a wedding” the poet tells us, “—unless you are here for a wedding.” There is so much fun in these pages that you know pain is real, there is so much feeling in the images, in the tonalities, in the sexiness of warning (that attraction transcends most sanity), in lips (each a strawberry perfectly split open), in silences (when a lover sleep-rhymes words that don’t rhyme), in dreams (that teach carousels are the best place for orgasms). Beware. These poems bewitch. You might just fall in love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are my MoviePass Reviews for the second trimester of the year. It was supposed to be by the quarter, but &lt;em&gt;time keeps on slippin’&lt;/em&gt;. I’m currently at 57 films seen out of my #100MoviesIn2015. Tonight, I’ll see Hitchcock's classic &lt;em&gt;Psycho&lt;/em&gt;, then &lt;em&gt;Black Mass&lt;/em&gt; the day after. I still need to see 42 films more films over the next 13 weeks if I want to hit my goal. That’s almost 4 movies a week. Yikes! Luckily, I have MoviePass—hence, these MoviePass Reviews. What is that you ask?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kevindublin.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/moviepass-reviews-2015.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="moviepass-reviews-2015" class="wp-image-100449 size-large" height="360" src="http://www.kevindublin.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/moviepass-reviews-2015-1024x768.jpg" width="480"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;a few of the tickets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MoviePass is a card that allows you to see unlimited films for $30/month — (&lt;a href="https://www.moviepass.com/referral/email/E5pxASeyUNLGc6XBztskAodEFVXHILi5LFDw9LikeqA%253D/1503631860105"&gt;http://movi.ps/referral&lt;/a&gt;). I love it. As you can tell, I’ve seen loads of movies this year. You can read the first trimester of MoviePass reviews &lt;a href="http://www.kevindublin.com/moviepass-review-2015/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I originally started my free two week trial on January 15, 2015. There are other reviews of the service, but I can honestly tell you that it’s the best entertainment decision I’ve made since buying a projector six years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to Optimize MoviePass&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of MoviePass reviews complain that it’s advertised as “unlimited movies” in theaters when it’s only one movie a day. This is a non-issue for me. I usually see about 2-3 movies on a good week. Most of the time I only see one movie on a day, but I just optimize my MoviePass if I don’t have weekend plans. The cool thing about MoviePass is that you can buy tickets in advance. My solution to seeing more than one movie in a day is buying an advanced ticket. I’ll show up on a Wednesday and buy a ticket for Saturday. This means that I can see a movie with that ticket and also check in for another movie if I decide to see something else. The great thing about movie theater folks is they are super nice. I buy advance tickets all of the time. Many times I miss the showings. If that happens, show up with your unused advance ticket. They’ll either give you a &lt;em&gt;re-admit&lt;/em&gt; pass or you can use it to get another ticket for a different movie. &lt;em&gt;Voila&lt;/em&gt;. So simple. There’s actually a bunch of &lt;em&gt;optimizations.&lt;/em&gt; I can write a post on how to use MoviePass for free if enough people comment and ask for it. I’ve been thinking of other MoviePass reviews I can write other than just the films. Maybe the theaters? After tonight, I will have earned back \$165 and 70 concession upgrades from AMC theaters alone. I’ve seen over \$700 worth of movies this year for just under \$75. If you’d like to sign up, do so here: &lt;a href="https://www.moviepass.com/referral/email/E5pxASeyUNLGc6XBztskAodEFVXHILi5LFDw9LikeqA%253D/1503631860105"&gt;http://movi.ps/referral&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;When Not to Sign Up for MoviePass&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a friend. I’m not going to say his name, but he’s on Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cjpendergraft"&gt;@cjpendergraft&lt;/a&gt;. You should follow him. He signed up for MoviePass in February and canceled it in May after seeing less than 5 movies. He just wasn’t going to the theater. From June until now, he’s seen more than 10 movies. He says he’s going to sign up again in October. He’s a lil fatheroo. Do not sign up for MoviePass if you aren’t going to theaters. A good way to engage is to start a scrapbook of movie tickets or write short MoviePass reviews. Make a habit of it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;29 Micro MoviePass Reviews&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dope – 9.5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only reason this movie doesn’t have a ten is because I think there needs to be some time before something is labeled perfection. This film accomplished everything it set out to. It was a hilarious comedy and the drama was compelling and genuine. Perhaps what really makes this movie so good are its arguments. Malcolm (Shameik Moore)’s final turn and speech on the “slippery slope” was a great moment, but his college essay illustrating what he learned and how that reflects our culture was amazing. The hood was a nice touch of visual rhetoric. The outlandish moments of comedy were handled well. The sophisticated comedic sequences helped balance those moments out. I think Dom (A\$AP Rocky) was a little under-utilized, but he was great in the scenes he was in. The soundtrack was amazing. I saw it three times in theaters. Rick Famuyiwa has made his masterpiece, despite what one of the &lt;a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/dope-2015"&gt;horrid reviewers&lt;/a&gt; desecrating Ebert's name had to say. This movie is nothing short of dope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kevindublin.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Dope-film.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="dope-film" class="wp-image-100450 size-medium" height="180" src="http://www.kevindublin.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Dope-film-300x180.jpg" width="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Jib (Tony Revolori), Diggy (Kiersey Clemons), and Malcolm (Shameik Moore) are Dope.&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jurassic World – 8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s be honest. A Jurassic Park movie is only as good as its raptors. Luckily, Blue and his team didn’t disappoint. We expect wondrous dinosaurs, thrilling chases, suspenseful hiding, and a huge battle at the end. I can honestly say that Jurassic World provided the best of all of these. The only thing that would’ve made it better is if the children were more than props and if the “love story” was meatier. I can’t complain, though. In place of that, it was also able to work in a level of social commentary which I’m sure was unsettling to some. Who goes to see a dinosaur movie and expects to consider how imperialism, capitalism, and white supremacy have poisoned our culture? Let’s just say, I know why Indominous Rex was white. I didn’t walk to see this movie a second time in theaters. I had to “RUN!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me and Earl and the Dying Girl – 7.5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On first viewing, I enjoyed this film, but not as much as I did the second time. Honestly, I was a little bothered by the depictions of Earl as this magical negro who liked to say "titties." And of how I wanted to know more of the dying girl's background. I realized I should probably read the book. I liked how the story of the film never got in the way of itself. The direction was interesting, the cutaways to the animated sequences were well-placed and added a unique charm. Their homage films were great. Rachel (Olivia Cooke) and Greg (Thomas Mann) were the focus of the central relationship throughout the story, but it was Earl (RJ Cyler) who stole the film and held the true emotional core/understanding. I liked the unreliable narrator aspect of it all. It did a good job operating within the young-adult-cancer-romances conventions, but could've worked against them a bit more. Nick Offerman, Greg’s dad in the film, was good, as was Molly Shannon. I wanted to know what happened to Earl, but it was Greg's story, so meh. Would've been better as an ensemble, but was still a touching and funny story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Batman v. Robin – 7.5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teckevinally, I saw this at Wondercon and not with MoviePass, but it was in a theater and I’m going for &lt;em&gt;#100MoviesIn2015&lt;/em&gt;. I didn’t like &lt;em&gt;Son of Batman&lt;/em&gt;. It felt really forced. The direction left a little to be desired. This film, though, may be one of the best in the DCAU, and that says a lot. The action sequences are stellar and well-placed throughout. The story’s theme centered on the relationship of trust between Bruce and Damien works well. Not to mention, the group that shows up. Yes. &lt;em&gt;Batman Versus Robin&lt;/em&gt; is the best DCAU feature since &lt;em&gt;Under the Red Hood&lt;/em&gt;, but not quite as good as &lt;em&gt;The Dark Knight Returns.&lt;/em&gt; Because, let’s be honest. When you successfully adapt that story, it’s hard to top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dragonball Z: Resurrection of F – 7.5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. Yes. Yes. Toriyama-sama is back! Great blend of action and comedy. The theme of the conflict between Goku and Vegeta pushed even further than it was in the series. Frieza’s return was wonderful. The fight scenes—wowsers! Wait, I just realized, is this available to stream yet? I might go watch it again right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Straight Outta Compton – 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This movie started out super intense. The actors were all pretty good, but Ice Cube Jr. killed it. It has a nice wedding of theme and action. The problem happened about two-thirds of the way through this unnecessarily long movie. It stopped telling a story and became fan-fiction. There was no need for Tupac to be in this movie. Snoop, maybe, but he wasn’t even utilized. It was great how they all hugged in the end. I’ll definitely re-watch the first half of this movie again. If nothing else is going on, I’ll play the other half while typing up blogs. F. Gary Gray’s directions was great, tho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ant-Man – 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was fun, funny, and kinda funky. This is probably the best “first” superhero movie since &lt;em&gt;Iron Man&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Batman Begins&lt;/em&gt;. Hopefully it doesn’t go the route of Stark because the second and third films in that series were terrible. The characters were all great in this film. The action was decently paced. The fight scenes were phenomenal and funny. I can’t wait for the Wasp to join.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Visit – 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a weird relationship with this movie. I watched the trailer for it and thought it was going to be M. Night’s comeback. I thought it would be brilliant. Then I saw that it was a Blum House production and lost all faith.  Watching it, I was uncomfortable. Not because of the naked grandma, she actually had a nice butt. Not because of horror-comedy, truth be told it’s one of my favorite genres when done well. Not because of the well-done framing and camera movement which was a perfect balance between “teenage handheld” and directed camera operator. I was uncomfortable because everyone was laughing so hard at the little rapping white boy. This broken non-corporeal representation of what Shyamalan and popular culture see as Blackness distilled into this cooning white kid wearing invisible blackface. Maybe I could’ve shrugged it off if his sister hadn’t called him “etkevinally-confused” or if it was played in a context other than a minstrel show. There were boycotts of &lt;em&gt;Get Hard&lt;/em&gt;, but the theatrical version of that film actually treated its characters with care. It was aware it was being insensitive and tried to hit broadly, then complicate the characters by implicating the system in which the characters were in. The character of Tyler, who raps and adds “ho” to the end of every verse was created out of ignorance. Back to the film: I didn’t expect it to end how it did—SPOILER FOLLOWS. IF YOU CONTINUE TO READ, YOU WILL KNOW HOW IT ENDS. YOU SHOULD SKIP TO THE NEXT REVIEW IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT—It could’ve been interesting if the grandparents succeeded in killing the kids or somehow got away. It would’ve made for an interesting &lt;em&gt;The Visit 2&lt;/em&gt; with the “grandparents” doing it again with another set of kids somehow, but the audience knowing it wasn’t them the entire time. He only would’ve needed another reason for the kids not to have known the grandparents. But that could’ve been an interesting tension in the movie. The kids could’ve suspected it, and it would’ve been loaded with dramatic irony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kevindublin.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/white-boy.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="tyler-the-visit" class="size-medium wp-image-100451" height="225" src="http://www.kevindublin.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/white-boy-300x225.png" width="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;How could you ever find this face offensive, Kevin?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spy – 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was expecting this movie to be terrible. I had already planned on walking out, falling asleep, or sneaking into another movie if it was too ridiculous and broad. This is probably the best film that isn’t &lt;em&gt;St. Vincent&lt;/em&gt; that Melissa McCarthy has been in. The writing for Jason Statham’s character may have been over the top at times, but everyone had a great chemistry. The story was competently written and legitimately funny. Rose Byrne was definitely a standout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mad Max: Fury Road – 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is I’m actually torn on whether I’d watch this again, but I’m leaning toward “yes.” It was a wild chase movie. It was wholly entertaining the first time through. It had a strong cast. I just don’t know if it mattered or was suspenseful enough that I’d enjoy it a second time. I think I’ll watch it again out of curiosity, but not desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ricki and the Flash – 6.5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diablo Cody likes to start with unlikable characters and use the script’s major dramatic question to argue for how that character is a decent human being. That's one of the reasons I like her scripts. She's also witty and isn't afraid to take it "there." This film just felt safe. Meryl Streep was great, of course. It was just surprisingly quiet. I did love the mother-daughter relationship and the mother-stepmother tension, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mission: Impossible: Rogue Nation – 6.5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first half of this movie was so boring. It was all setup. The payoffs weren’t even that good. The twists were fairly expected. The second half was thrilling. It was fast-paced, the villainy was nice. And the ending? Enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cinderella – 6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a mildly entertaining live-action retelling of the classic fairy tale. When adapting a much-adapted piece, the best films try something bold and new or add an interesting twist. This adaptation did not. It was sufficient. Cate Blanchett was a rotten stepmother, not quite evil enough for me, though. And the writing didn’t allow enough room for motivation, but Lilly James was really charming. The best moment in the entire movie was, “I forgive you.” That was a nice touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pitch Perfect 2 – 6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never saw the first Pitch Perfect. Honestly, I didn’t even see every minute of this one. It was funny. Friendship, yay! Competition, yay! I was surprised at the politically incorrect tone of the humor, but it was refreshing. This genre is usually stale. Nice to see this decent example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paper Towns – 6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a promising story! Such a great lesson. The characters were also fairly well-developed … but …  the ending. It ran out of steam near the third act. I’m sorry, John Greene, but Jesse Andrews wins this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inside Out – 5.5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember very little about this movie. The external world of Riley was much more interesting than the world in her head. It seemed more like an exploration of how the brain works for kids instead of an entertaining story for kids. Good concept, boring execution. It was shiny, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trainwreck – 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love Amy Schumer. She just doesn’t know how to write long-form stories yet. The story was very generic, but the bit jokes were funny. It had its moments, but this was just a less-than-generic rom-com with a gender swap. Schumer’s name did a lot to promote this movie. It has prompted me to re-watch older Apatow movies because I thought he was a better director than this. The scene which was supposed to be homage to Woody Allen’s Manhattan was ridiculously sloppy. It made me aware of how poorly shot the whole film was. I wonder if his writing hid the bad direction or if he’s just incompetent with someone else’s work.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kevindublin.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/trainwreck.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="trainwreck" class="size-medium wp-image-100453" height="200" src="http://www.kevindublin.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/trainwreck-300x200.jpg" width="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Amy (Amy Schumer) and Aaron (Bill Hader) during this Trainwreck.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ted 2 - 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jokes were really funny in this movie. The story was absurd and barely existed. The difference between this and say &lt;em&gt;Trainwreck&lt;/em&gt; is there was no real intention to tell a story. There was a bit so funny in this movie that I missed half of the next scene because everyone in the theater was laughing too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vacation – 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people hate this movie. It’s actually not that bad. The problem is that it’s made in the style of a ridiculous 80’s American farce. They aren’t particularly good. Neither is this movie, but if you watch it on its own terms it has some funny moments. Those moments are mostly when there’s a little dramatic irony. The vomiting was dumb. The language was cringe-worthy and useless sometimes. We never care about the characters. Chevy Chase and Beverly D’Angelo weren’t really utilized for comedy. That wingman hut tub scene, though, ha! If you do like it, you'd probably like &lt;em&gt;We're the Millers&lt;/em&gt; (2013). It also features Ed Sudeikis, but is funnier American farce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avengers: Age of Ultron – 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure what I could say that hasn’t already been said about this movie. It would’ve been better if it was thirty minutes shorter, there wasn’t an out of place “love story,” and it had a better villain. Ultron wasn’t a powerful villain. Each of his sentinels were easily dispatched. They weren’t a real threat. Do you know who would’ve been a real threat to the Avengers and force them to change the way they fight? The Vision. He was wasted. He should’ve been under the thrall of Ultron as Queen of the big bad and maneuvered against the Avengers until the second to last sequence. Ah well. We got to see Hulk vs. Hulkbuster Iron Man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;San Andreas – 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things blew up and fell apart. Dwayne Johnson saved folks. There was a story. The character motivations, everything really, felt expected. I did enjoy it while it was on. That girl's stepdad was a jerk, haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome to Me – 4.5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could’ve been good. Kristen Wiig was great. The premise was interesting. It just meandered on screen. It is a completely forgettable film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hot Pursuit – 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was simple, basic, and barely entertaining. But Sofía Vergara was lovely, Reese Witherspoon was adorable, and they have great chemistry. It would have been better if they only had a script with fewer clichés and interesting plotting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;True Story – 3.5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a lot of sitting together and uninteresting discussion in this movie. If I was at this movie alone, I would’ve walked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fantastic Four – 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was very little conflict in this movie until the third act when an all-powerful Doctor Doom started exploding the heads of everyone he encountered and then tried to blow up the world. The normal chemistry between Michael B. Jordan and Miles Teller was absent. Kate Mara was competent and cute. There wasn’t enough written for Jamie Bell. This script failed because it began as a small coming of age story at the beginning with a theme that revolved around friendship (yay, &lt;em&gt;Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;), but it ended as a generic superhero movie circa 1999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age of Adaline – 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example of what happens when you don’t have any conflict in a story until the third act. It was super melodramatic and ultimately pointless. I’m sure it works better as a book because it allows more interiority. As a film, meh. The reveal in the third act would’ve been better revealed closer to the midpoint and explored through the rest of the movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Gift – 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow. I like revenge stories. I really like suspenseful thrillers and mysteries. It’s too bad that this had no suspense, wasn’t at all thrilling, and the only two mysteries weren’t teased well. I liked Edgerton’s earlier film with his brother, &lt;em&gt;The Square&lt;/em&gt;. He was also good as Tom in &lt;em&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/em&gt;. This movie was sloppy. It might’ve been played better as a comedy with unreliable characters. It was melodramatic and boring. Nice reveal at the end, though. I guess that’s why others like it so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kevindublin.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/The-Gift-Poo.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="the-gift" class="size-medium wp-image-100454" height="300" src="http://www.kevindublin.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/The-Gift-Poo-202x300.png" width="202"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Not every gift is welcome&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tomorrowland – 1.5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directionless. Pointless. The character motivations were so constructed and phony. The visuals were only mildly interesting. George Clooney’s charm was even muted. Raffey Cassidy did well. I have a feeling this script was more Lindelof than Brad Bird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aloha – N/A&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think it would be fair for me to rate this movie. The first two sequences were so bad that I walked out of the theater. I had very little idea of what the direction of the movie was going to be or why I should care about any of the random gibberish spewing from the characters’ mouths. I bet that’s why it didn’t do well. I really like Bradley Cooper and Emma Stone. I wish they were in a better movie together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ratings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1-3&lt;/strong&gt;: Horrible. I regret subjecting myself to this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4-5&lt;/strong&gt;: Just below average, but not a complete waste of time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;: I didn’t waste my time, but I wouldn’t go out of my way to watch it again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7-8&lt;/strong&gt;: Accomplished what it set out to do and I’d watch it again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9-10&lt;/strong&gt;: Nearly perfect. Highly recommend it as art&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the name of poetic freedom, the Red Poets Society has been formed. Together we shall join weekly in the belly of Kafé Sobaka to celebrate all that is verse. Come all lyricists and crafters of the spoken word. Sally forth with your inklings and rhyme; share with your comrades the joy that is poetic expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rules: there are no rules but that which you pin upon your work, but seriously: each reader gets 5 uninterrupted (save for angry crowds) minutes to read their work; no music is allowed save as accompaniment to the reading; boring long winded pieces will be shunned appropriately; and stand-up comedy will not be tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also ask that you purchase either one drink or one food item in order to help maintain the sacred space. (See below.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realize that our intention is a collaboration of poets and critics and that verbal sass can and will be the only response to lyrical laziness and foolish ramblings. We want for your best and those striving to create difference and beauty with their work. We seek to offer a space in which to be both avant-garde and accepted, but also to be critiqued and honed into a better writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, each month as a special feature to the open mic session, a committee-elected featured performer shall woo the masses with their epic verse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open mic sign up starts at 6:30 p.m., the first performer speaks at 7 p.m. Eat, drink, be merry, verbalize! Skoal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-hosts: Tazha Williams &amp;amp; David Proulx&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starts at 7pm, sign up is at 6:30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No cover but there is a one drink or one food item minimum, which is facilitated with a \$5 RED TICKET:&lt;br&gt;
In order to simplify the chaos a bit, we will "sell" you a \$5 ticket at entry, which can be used for any drink (shot of vodka, beer, wine, Turkish coffee*, etc.) or as a \$5 credit for food. So plan to bring a few bucks for this purpose. Everything can be ordered at the counter and a number will be issued for delivery to your table (no wait service during the event).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="archive"></category></entry><entry><title>Poetry Ruckus</title><link href="https://kevindublin.com/poetry-ruckus-3.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-05-27T21:08:00-07:00</published><updated>2015-05-27T21:08:00-07:00</updated><author><name>kevin</name></author><id>tag:kevindublin.com,2015-05-27:/poetry-ruckus-3.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A monthly open mike event for local poets to share their work.

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday 5/27/15, Ruthless Hippies proudly presents the Poetry Ruckus at Ducky Waddle’s (414 N Coast Hwy 101 Leucadia) featuring guest poet Shannon Linzer!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shannon Linzer is a local San Diego poet whose work focuses on identity, privilege, queerness and religion. She is a regular in the San Diego open mic &amp;amp; slam scene, and has featured at Jhimye Poetry &amp;amp; Lyrical Exchange in North Park. Her work has been published in Spit Journal. When not writing, Shannon spends her time teaching all manner of things—English, exercise, handstands and cat tricks. Look for her daily haiku on facebook and her first short collection of poems, due out this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my MoviePass Review 2015 (of the first trimester).  It’s a milestone! I’ve seen 25 movies (actually 28) with MoviePass.

&lt;p&gt;This is my MoviePass Review 2015 (of the first trimester).  It’s a milestone! I’ve seen 25 movies (actually 28) with MoviePass. MoviePass is a card that allows you to see unlimited films for \$30/month — (&lt;a href="https://www.moviepass.com/referral/email/E5pxASeyUNLGc6XBztskAodEFVXHILi5LFDw9LikeqA%253D/1503631860105"&gt;http://movi.ps/referral&lt;/a&gt;). I love it. I’ve seen loads of movies this year. I originally started my free two week trial on January 15, 2015. It’s been three months. You can read &lt;a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/my-months-with-moviepass-the-ultimate-service-for-movie-geeks/"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.geekenstein.com/6-reasons-why-moviepass-sucks/"&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt; of the service, but it’s the best entertainment decision I’ve made since buying a projector six years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_100383" align="aligncenter" width="480"]&lt;a href="http://www.kevindublin.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/moviepass.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="moviepass review 2015" class="size-large wp-image-100383" height="328" src="http://www.kevindublin.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/moviepass-1024x699.png" width="480"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The well-worn card I used for my MoviePass Review 2015[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The Financial Benefits of MoviePass&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was charged after my first full month of MoviePass on March 3, 2015. Since I live in the large metro area of San Diego, my bill was \$35 not the usual \$30. San Diego has 20 theaters within 30 miles of my house that support MoviePass. This includes all of the AMC, Regal and Edwards theaters, United Artist theaters, all but one of the Readings Cinemas, and three independent theaters. Two of the supported theaters even host many of the films of a few of San Diego’s annual festivals including the &lt;a href="http://www.sdfilmfest.com/"&gt;San Diego Film Festival&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sdlatinofilm.com/"&gt;San Diego Latino Film Festival&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.sdbff.com/"&gt;San Diego Black Film Festival&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My MoviePass Review 2015 has to include a financial breakdown on my way to #100MoviesIn2015. Three payments of \$35 is \$105. But I enticed two of my friends to become MoviePass members. MoviePass has an incentive, and you receive a \$10 credit for each new member you recommend. I received a \$20 credit. That brings the total paid down to \$85. Twenty-eight movies for \$85 isn’t bad (approx. \$3/movie), but I did better. I joined AMC’s Stubs reward program. They credit you \$10 for every \$100 you spend in tickets or concessions. I saw 21 of the 28 movies in AMC theaters for this very reason. Tickets at the two theaters are \$12.79 each. That’s about \$268 in ticket prices alone. When you include the movies that I saw with one or both of my friends and scanned my reward card with their purchases, I’ve gotten back \$40 in rewards. I’ve used it on additional tickets for people accompanying me. The \$40 rewards return ends it at \$45 for 28 movies or \$1.60 per movie.

&lt;h3&gt;28 Micro Reviews&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This MoviePass Review 2015 wouldn’t be complete without a list of the movies I’ve seen along with micro-reviews and ratings. I planned on getting MoviePass at the end of the previous year, so a few of the films are from 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Imitation Game – 9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compelling story. Great acting.  A story that reminds or teaches us, “Sometimes it is the people who no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selma – 8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting story. Oleyowo brings new dimension to how MLK Jr. has been portrayed in mainstream media. Ava DuVernay &amp;amp; Paul Webb created a film that complicated a story that I felt like I knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inherent Vice - 7.5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m still not completely sure of all that I watched. Funny and unsettling, PTA delivers in this Pynchon adaptation with Joaquin Phoenix, Josh Brolin, and Katherine Waterston dazzling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big Eyes - 7.5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who would have thought that if Tim Burton directed a film by the writers of &lt;em&gt;Problem Child&lt;/em&gt; (1990) and &lt;em&gt;Man on the Moon&lt;/em&gt; (1999) it would be so exciting? It’s visually stunning and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Furious 7 - 7.5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fast &amp;amp; Furious 6&lt;/em&gt; (2013) was a sequel-prequel-reboot that elevated the already growing B Movie franchise to art. The art in this film is recklessness, and it has a tender heart. Exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While We’re Young - 7.5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only other film written by Baumbach that I like is &lt;em&gt;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou&lt;/em&gt; (2004), but this film is funny and presents an interesting debate about success and commentary on millennials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Danny Collins – 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan Fogelman’s directing debut. Pacino’s chemistry with everyone is great, especially Bening. What begins as a story on choice of an artistic path becomes a wonderful Father/Son tale of redemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theory of Everything – 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redmayne’s Oscar was well-deserved. I’m not positive I’d ever seek this film out to ever watch it again. It’s an interesting and informational film biography whereas &lt;em&gt;Imitation Game&lt;/em&gt; (2014) was a story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top Five – 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loose, funny, and romantic. Chris Rock has found a way to tell a story well and hits his stride as a writer/director/actor. I wish the title was riffed on for another dimension, but I can’t complain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Hard – 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a hilariously crude social satire filled with dramatic irony that allowed the dynamic comedic chemistry of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell to exist together. Let’s hope these two work together again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus – 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It worked the turns well. Will Smith was in top movie star form. This romantic comedy hidden in a heist/con-artist movie was fun and occasionally thrilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kingsman – 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samuel L. Jackson’s villain was hilarious. The silliness, including the conclusion to the climax, fit well in this very Matthew Vaughn film. The surrogate father/son story gave it heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;El Incidente – 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This frustratingly intriguing sci-fi film is Isaac Ezban’s first feature film. It proves him an exciting director, sharp writer, and has a concept that will fold your brain over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ex Machina - 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how you tell a story around a thought experiment. Thrilling soundtrack. Visually intriguing. Contained and bubbling over the edges. Very well-acted and a surprisingly funny, fresh film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Almanac – 6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premise is wasted a little and the first act is too long, but it’s a fun, youthful movie. Sofia Black D’Elia was the stand out. The whole cast had chemistry. I wrote a longer review of the film &lt;a href="http://www.kevindublin.com/review-project-almanac/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;American Sniper – 5.5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Eastwood’s best. It’s never actually thrilling. Cooper works well as the unapologetically patriotic Kyle. It’s a relief when it’s over, but there are some sequences in the film which work well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unfriended - 5.5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept and ingenuity put it past many of the teen “horror” films. It’s not scary and the death scenes are silly, but commitment to the concept and anti-bullying stance make it interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies - 5.5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trilogy would’ve been much better as a single movie or maybe two movies. Fantasy action was nice. I assume there was character development. It was visually interesting, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Home – 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a charming children’s adventure tale. It wasn’t much more than that, but it accomplishes precisely what it wants to and brings a few laughs along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Lazarus Effect – 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seemed more like a two-part beginning of a television series than a film. It was interesting to watch, but ultimately didn’t end up going anywhere. The cast did a good job, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunger Games: Mockingjay, pt. 1 – 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a lot of whining. Katniss wasn’t the strong symbol she’s been in the past. It wasn’t exciting, but it advanced the story. I imagine it would’ve benefited from not being a two-part finale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;50 Shades of Grey – 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was curious. I knew that I’d never read the book. Surprisingly competent film. The ending didn’t exist, but I’ll see the next installment since I have MoviePass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Into the Woods - 4.5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;he first half of this story is really good. The second half is super sloppy. The actors all do such a wonderful job while it’s happening, though, that it only bothered me just a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Duff – 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately forgettable. Robbie Amell and Mae Whitman were charming. It didn’t really argue its message that well and felt like a hundred other high school movies about discovering self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Run all Night – 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I barely remember this sloppy story. If it had spent more time developing the characters, this could’ve been a decent movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chappie – 3.5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Die Antwoord advertisement has a talking robot and a bunch of nitwits in it. It feigns intelligence and attempts to use the soundtrack to push it forward. A bore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It Follows – 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This movie is piss drizzle in the pants. You keep watching it, thinking that it’ll end better than it started. It doesn’t. It never does. Boring waste of a good concept. Check out longer review &lt;a href="http://www.kevindublin.com/review-it-follows/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jupiter Ascending – 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what made this film so bad. The poor story? The unexplained absence of anyone else with rocket boots? The convoluted action? The bad motivations of the characters? Disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Boy Next Door – 0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the worst movie I’ve seen in a long time. It wasn’t suspenseful. It wasn’t funny. It wasn’t even sexy. It was a poor attempt to turn a tired genre on its head with bad writing and acting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ratings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1-3&lt;/strong&gt;: Horrible. I regret subjecting myself to this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4-5&lt;/strong&gt;: Just below average, but not a complete waste of time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;: I didn’t waste my time, but I wouldn’t go out of my way to watch it again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7-8&lt;/strong&gt;: Accomplished what it set out to do and I’d watch it again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9-10&lt;/strong&gt;: Nearly perfect. Highly recommend it as art&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;MoviePass Review 2015 Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a lot of movies that I normally wouldn’t have considered. There were times when I would show up and see what was playing next. I have the goal of seeing #100MoviesIn2015 in theaters. MoviePass will definitely help save money and motivate me. I want to do it to help me understand the art form better. My MoviePass Review 2015 (so far) has been great, and I’m sure it will get even better.&lt;/p&gt;

In 25 years of collecting, the Athenaeum artists’ book collection has grown into an important resource for artists, researchers, and presses. While portions of the collection are continually displayed for visitors in the Athenaeum’s North Reading Room and are also available for use by appointment, this exhibition provides unprecedented access to over 50 books by 36 local artists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The artists’ books featured often push the form, employ a wide assortment of materials and methods of bookbinding, and explore varied subjects from the personal to the public. Through the outstanding collection of the Athenaeum, [UN]BOUND offers a unique opportunity to discover the book as both object and idea in the hands of San Diego artists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris Mosher started performing in 2002. Having grown up an artist and painter, he found his voice through a plethora of emerging vocalists, improvisers, and a small group of fellow rappers, musicians, and poets. Moving up and down the coast, recording and performing with friends and on his own, he has crafted a unique and lasting persona in both the spoken word and music scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shannon Perkins began performing in 2000 and quickly found herself on the San Diego Poetry Slam team the following year. As a part of multiple groups including Able Minded Poets and currently Ogd_s(11) Translation Has Failed, she has honed her craft as a performance poet. She has also shifted her attention toward visual art, featuring in galleries up and down the West Coast. Shannon was most recently featured on Ogd_s(11)’s album Falling Too Slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan Hubbard is one of San Diego’s busiest percussionists, leading several genre-pushing groups and collaborating with many of San Diego's finest. His five-volume album set, Encinitas and Everything After, was named Best Jazz Album at the San Diego Music Awards in October 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DJ Gill Sotu will also provide music. Sotu has opened for Grammy-nominated Sheila E, and partnered and performed with the San Diego Symphony. He has been commissioned to create numerous poetry pieces for the United Way of San Diego and performed for TEDx San Diego in December 2013. Sotu has been featured on NBC 7’s Art Pulse TV and was named the 2012 &amp;amp; 2013 San Diego RAW Performing Artist of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The People’s Choice Poem Performance Award – All participants read/perform one poem under three minutes long. Audience members choose (by secret ballot) their favorite poem based on content and performance. Props, artwork, singing, music, dancing, all accompaniment is allowed and anything goes. Top poem performances (the poems that receive the most votes) win \$50. Audience members will be encouraged to hoot for their favorites and try to influence the rest of the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writers/artists who would like to participate in the People’s Choice Poem Performance Awards can get their names in the hat ahead of time at mkklam\@gmail.com or sign in on the night of the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is FREE and open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Middleton is the author of the forthcoming Physics Envy (Chicago), a book about American poetry and science in the Cold War due to appear later in 2015. He is also the author of books on poetry and performance, a co-authored book on memory, and a study of masculinity, as well as many essays on modern poetry, and on literature and science, including climate change. He is currently the Secretary of the British Society for Literature and Science. Educated in both the United Kingdom and the United States, he is a Professor of English at the University of Southampton, UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What role does poetry play in public life? This question has led my research for many years. I have studied poetry performance, the gender politics of poetry, poetry as cultural memory, the role of little magazines, changing readerships, and most recently the interplay between poetry and science. Given the rigor required by scientific research, what possible use is a form of writing not grounded in exact knowledge other than as a cheerleader or critic on the sidelines? Recently I have been working with clinical researchers who are challenging the dogma that DNA is our medical fate. They are finding signs that the actions of the genes can be altered by environmental factors, alterations that may even last for generations. We appear to be on the verge of a new era of genetic medicine or epigenetics. Can poetry play any part in this? My talk explores the contribution that poetry can make to the wider public assessment of the linguistic, metaphorical, cultural, and ethical implications of such developments."&lt;/p&gt;

I love it. I’ve seen loads of movies this year. &lt;em&gt;It Follows&lt;/em&gt; is the most recent. These micro reviews of the films’ storytelling are a way to catalog what I've seen and what I think about story. I dash them off. If you want to talk about the film, feel free to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;It Follows&lt;/em&gt; Review&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It Follows&lt;/em&gt; was absolutely boring and a complete waste of a wonderful concept. There’s so little actual conflict. There is a lot of driving away. How terrifying is a monster that you can hop on a plane and fly away from? There’s no escalation of the stakes because there’s no logical plan to stop “the entity” because the entity is vaguely setup and few “rules” are ever established for how it functions. Sure, it follows you and it kills you. Is it punishment for sleeping with the wrong mate? Maybe. The first victim’s leg is broken and her neck snapped. The guy who gives it to Jay (protagonist) says “don’t let it touch you.” Yet, it grabs Jay no less than three times and she is fine. The second guy, Greg, was incestuously raped to death. It follows you only by walking. Maybe it can even walk into the water or over an ocean. Who knows? At the climax of &lt;em&gt;It Follows&lt;/em&gt;, we learn that the entity is sentient and can form plans. Yes, that’s correct; we learn a critical ability of the man antagonist only near the end. The rest of the film it mindlessly shuffles. Oh, and it throws rocks in windows when it can’t open a door. Sometimes it takes on the appearance of people you know or love. Note: There is absolutely no emotional resonance for the appearance it takes during the climax. Why? We hadn't learned anything previously about that person. That’s poor storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_100299" align="aligncenter" width="300"]&lt;a href="http://itfollowsfilm.com/"&gt;&lt;img alt="it-follows-review" class="size-medium wp-image-100299" height="169" src="http://www.kevindublin.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/itfollows-main-300x169.jpg" width="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Never enter a place with one exit[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Interpreting &lt;em&gt;It Follows&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if it wasn’t about the entity, and what follows is supposed to serve as a larger metaphor. Well, it’s a poorly articulated metaphor. Sex Follows: Don’t have casual sex because it follows you everywhere you go. Eventually it destroys you. It will destroy your sexual partners along the way. Poor Decisions Follow: Don’t make decisions in the moment. Important decisions will follow you your entire life. They will hurt people along the way. Maybe it’s just social commentary: In our culture, decisions are made too casually. These decisions, like sex, have implications beyond the present. We also hurt the ones closest to us. I would get into the possible romantic metaphors, but I’ll leave that to a Red Pill / Alpha Male blogger. I wouldn’t bet money on any of those interpretations because of the fatalistic ending. &lt;a href="http://msmagazine.com/blog/2015/02/26/it-follows-a-horror-film-that-doesnt-blame-the-victim-for-having-sex/"&gt;Most reviewers&lt;/a&gt; stretch the vague rhetorical implications of the film to fit their own agenda or lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_100300" align="aligncenter" width="300"]&lt;a href="http://vitaminw.co/culture-society/horror-movies-women-and-stereotypes"&gt;&lt;img alt="it-follows-review" class="size-medium wp-image-100300" height="169" src="http://www.kevindublin.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/itfollowsbeta-300x169.jpg" width="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; We've never seen a woman punished for her sexual choices before in film, so that was a great twist[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Learning from &lt;em&gt;It Follows&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t want this to be merely a rant of why I didn’t like &lt;em&gt;It Follows&lt;/em&gt;. It could’ve improved by crafting sequences that actually had conflict. One solution is to take away driving or biking away as an option. It was fine for that to happen the first time, but you want conflict to escalate. Imagine if the car had broken down. Then Jay would’ve been stuck running, which is way more dream-like. It also would’ve forced her to come up with more creative ways to stop the entity. I’m sorry, but trying to shoot it? On three separate occasions?!?! It didn’t work the first time! It’s not going to work the second or third times!! Insanity. Also, running upstairs to escape is never a good idea. Another thing that would’ve improved the story is clear rules for the entity. Let’s go back to the car issue. This is a trickster ghoul. It’s intelligent enough to appear as people you may know. It knows not to fall for the idiotic trap they set at the climax. It can break through windows and attack people that don’t see it. Apparently, it’s not smart enough to flatten tires. Imagine Jay getting into a car and trying to drive off, but the tires are flat, so she has to slowly drive in car on flat tires while it follows in the rearview. There weren’t enough well-crafted obstacles in the film. Imagine a policeman pulling Jay over. The entity approaches as she talks to the officer. She freaks out. He can’t see it. He handcuffs her to restrain her and it is approaching during this entire sequence. It’s nerve-wracking! Why? because she has two antagonists agitating the scene from two different worlds. There’s an immediate threat and a larger one more present. This story only dealt with the larger threat and gave easy outs. There’s nothing suspenseful about being able to drive away from your threat. You could even bike away, or run, or jog, or skip. The first victim we see die, died only because she gave up. I suppose I should say something nice about it. Coming of age is important It was wise to use characters at the end of their teenage years. It was interesting visually. The rig used in Jay’s introduction was good. The 360 spin in the school and the choice to use lots of wide shots was a good one. The naked man standing on the roof scene was also creepy. The attempt to set the film in an indiscriminate era was good, but it just looked like the early 1990’s with cheap eReaders to me. The color grading was a good choice, though. I hope &lt;em&gt;Unfriended&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t disappoint me as much as &lt;em&gt;It Follows&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This film has become a sort of &lt;a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/it_follows/"&gt;critical&lt;/a&gt; indie horror darling. It’s praised for its originality and intelligence. I guess the horror genre is so piss poor these days that &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3235888/"&gt;most people&lt;/a&gt; are easily impressed, especially when Dostoyevsky and T.S. Eliot are referenced. I wish Roger Ebert was still alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;It Follows&lt;/em&gt; Rating: 2.5 out of 10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1-3: Horrible. I regret subjecting myself to this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4-5: Just below average, but not a complete waste of time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6: I didn’t waste my time, but I wouldn’t go out of my way to watch it again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7-8: Accomplished what it set out to do and I’d watch it again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9-10: Nearly perfect.

I love it. I've seen loads of movies in the last month. Project Almanac is the most recent. These micro reviews of the films' storytelling are a way to catalog what I've seen and think about story. I dash them off. If you want to talk about the film, feel free to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Project Almanac Review&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from a rocky beginning with a ridiculously long first act, Project Almanac was successful. More laughs in the beginning of the 2nd act would’ve made the fun and games more exciting. There was also barely any conflict for the majority of the movie. I would’ve liked to see more shaved from the first act and more time spent in Project Almanac’s rich area of potential conflict. The third act was rushed and barely existed. The ending was well done, though. Project Almanac will inevitably draw comparisons to earlier MTV Films teen sci-fi film Chronicle. But Chronicle gave its actors a stronger script that focused on conflict, so the drama was more compelling. Project Almanac could’ve easily had that drama, but it might’ve pandered too much to its teenage crowd. Oh, and that Microsoft product placement. I assume we will see more of that in the future. Overall, I’d recommend the film as a teen sci-fi popcorn flick for those who just want to have fun. There is a particularly touching scene in the third act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did they...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose found footage as the way to tell this story? It might've worked better and avoided some of the comparisons without that choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not use the father/son element as a way to drive the protagonist's goal?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not explore the title "Project Almanac" more in the film? It's the title of the project, but "second chances" wasn't enough to make sense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid ALL conflict for the first two-thirds of the film? Would've been stronger if "the rule" was broken earlier with smaller consequences building.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Almanac Rating: 6 out of 10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1-3: Horrible. I regret subjecting myself to this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4-5: Just below average, but not a complete waste of time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6: I didn't waste my time, but I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7-8: Accomplished what it set out to do and I'd watch it again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9-10: Nearly perfect. Highly recommend it as art&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;food: we will have some snacks/appetizers, but it would be awesome if you all brought stuff to share too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;drinks: we will have some stuff, but, again, byob if you're a picky freak. in other words, bring something to share, or you will be scoffed at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;after naughty santa, we will probably continue to consume beverages. it has been a loooooong semester for many of us. then, we will most likely head to the nearest adult watering hole to keep our throats slick with social lubrication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lose something every day. Accept the fluster&lt;br&gt;
of lost door keys, the hour badly spent.&lt;br&gt;
The art of losing isn’t hard to master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then practice losing farther, losing faster:&lt;br&gt;
places, and names, and where it was you meant&lt;br&gt;
to travel. None of these will bring disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lost my mother’s watch. And look! my last, or&lt;br&gt;
next-to-last, of three loved houses went.&lt;br&gt;
The art of losing isn’t hard to master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster,&lt;br&gt;
some realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.&lt;br&gt;
I miss them, but it wasn’t a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Even losing you (the joking voice, a gesture&lt;br&gt;
I love) I shan’t have lied. It’s evident&lt;br&gt;
the art of losing’s not too hard to master&lt;br&gt;
though it may look like (&lt;em&gt;Write it&lt;/em&gt;!) like disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it's fitting that I post this on Mother's Day. Loss is the most universal, prevalent, primal feeling human’s experience. Some might say it is love, but I would argue that we’re keenly aware when we lose something and may not be aware when we love something (or someone). Combine that with a masterful, seamless poetic display in one of the most difficult verse forms to master in English (that isn’t redundant game-playing-- I'm looking at you sestina) and you will have what I might consider the best poem I’ve ever read, Elizabeth Bishop’s “One Art.” It’s so unassuming, so simple, yet so complex. Hearing this poem read aloud for the first time in a Forms of Poetry classroom read wonderfully by Poet/Professor Michael White changed my life. Not in one of those hyperbolic, 21^st^ century teenager ways either. Before that class I was more interested in poetry as expression, poetry as philosophy, and, mostly, poetry as performance. I wanted to cry after he finished reading it. It was a release. Later, re-reading it, I did cry. I became obsessed with Bishop afterwards; I fell in love with the dead lesbian who shook me into wanting to become the poet that I want to be. I devoured everything: her poems, prose, biography, art, and letters. I saved bits of each, so that I might one day discover something “new.” So I may be a bit bias. To the point, “One Art” is a villanelle. If you think about Bishop’s biography, then this poem is usually connected to her time abroad in Brazil, her mother’s insanity and later death, her return to America from Brazil, an ex-lover’s (Lota de Macedo Soares’) suicide, and an estrangement from a young lover, Alice Methfessel. I believe the poem is about all of these things and none of them. It’s a writing through, universal sort of poem that requires no context, but becomes even richer once you have it. “One Art” is from Bishop’s final collection, &lt;em&gt;Geography III&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Audio, Poetry, Spoken Word"></category><category term="Elizabeth Bishop Sunday"></category><category term="NPM"></category><category term="poetry"></category></entry><entry><title>Red Like Our Room Used to Feel</title><link href="https://kevindublin.com/red-like-our-room.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-05-06T05:05:00-07:00</published><updated>2013-05-06T05:05:00-07:00</updated><author><name>kevin</name></author><id>tag:kevindublin.com,2013-05-06:/red-like-our-room.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So first off, the website went down during April.

Under his spine. A terrible, stump-legged waddle&lt;br&gt;
Like a thick Aztec disemboweller,&lt;br&gt;
Club-swinging, trying to grind some square&lt;br&gt;
Socket between his hind legs round,&lt;br&gt;
Carrying his head like a brazier of spilling embers,&lt;br&gt;
And the black bit of his mouth, he takes it&lt;br&gt;
Between his back teeth, he has to wear his skin out,&lt;br&gt;
He swipes a lap at the water-trough as he turns,&lt;br&gt;
Swiveling the ball of his heel on the polished spot,&lt;br&gt;
Showing his belly like a butterfly&lt;br&gt;
At every stride he has to turn a corner&lt;br&gt;
In himself and correct it. His head&lt;br&gt;
Is like the worn down stump of another whole jaguar,&lt;br&gt;
His body is just the engine shoving it forward,&lt;br&gt;
Lifting the air up and shoving on under,&lt;br&gt;
The weight of his fangs hanging the mouth open,&lt;br&gt;
Bottom jaw combing the ground. A gorged look,&lt;br&gt;
Gangster, club-tail lumped along behind gracelessly,&lt;br&gt;
He's wearing himself to heavy ovals,&lt;br&gt;
Muttering some mantra, some drum-song of murder&lt;br&gt;
To keep his rage brightening, making his skin&lt;br&gt;
Intolerable, spurred by the rosettes, the cain-brands,&lt;br&gt;
Wearing the spots from the inside,&lt;br&gt;
Rounding some revenge. Going like a prayer-wheel,&lt;br&gt;
The head dragging forward, the body keeping up,&lt;br&gt;
The hind legs lagging. He coils, he flourishes&lt;br&gt;
The blackjack tail as if looking for a target,&lt;br&gt;
Hurrying through the underworld, soundless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;On Second Glance at a Jaguar&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Second Glance at a Jaguar" is probably my favorite &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/ted-hughes" title="Read More about Hughes"&gt;Ted Hughes&lt;/a&gt; poem. It captures the raw, animal rhythms of his poetry. It has great imagery. "Second Glance at a Jaguar" revisits a poem, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWXL5WOvc1M" title="Hughes Reading The Jaguar"&gt;"Jaguar,"&lt;/a&gt; from his first collection &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hawk_in_the_Rain" title="Didn't want to link to this because it mentions Plath, but..."&gt;[The Hawk in the Rain]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}&lt;/a&gt;. The first jaguar poem is about how animals in a zoo are so depressed, caged in slots and separated, but content with it except the Jaguar who "... hurrying enraged / Through prison darkness after the drills of his eyes // On a short fierce fuse." Hughes is almost certainly making a connection to humanity in that poem. This second jaguar poem is all about those moments, those movements. He's pacing as if he's plotting, as if his refusal to grow weary is an act of rebellion. Hughes said that poems are like animals; he addresses this in &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/4NkccTYsaVk" title="Hughes briefly talking about and reading &amp;quot;The Thought-Fox&amp;quot;"&gt;another poem&lt;/a&gt;. He wrote &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Crow-Ted-Hughes/dp/0571099157" title="I highly recommend this book"&gt;a lot about animals&lt;/a&gt; and many times as a way to talk about humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no legal copy of Ted Hughes reading "Second Glance at a Jaguar" online. You'll have to buy the wonderful CD, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ted-Hughes-Reading-His-Poetry/dp/0007202644"&gt;Ted Hughes Reading His Poetry&lt;/a&gt; to hear it. But here's Seamus Heaney reading "The Thought Fox" by Ted Hughes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;A More Academic Way of Discussing Second Glance at a Jaguar&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Second Glance at a Jaguar” is a 33 line consonantal or alliterative accentual verse poem. It is written with a large influence of the Anglo-Saxon and Old English traditions. It is also very aware of the Modern relative stress principle and the limitations of the English language in the approach of a more Germanic prosody. The jaguar can also be seen as a direct metaphor for Hughes’ own relationship with poetics in his contemporary landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In “&lt;a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/20058780?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents"&gt;Imagining Ted Hughes&lt;/a&gt;,” scholar Ryan Hibbett briefly analyzes the authorship of Hughes and his “place in English poetry” (Hibbett, 416). Early on, Hibbett quotes Hughes who wrote, “I think of poems as a sort of animal. They have their own life, like animals, by which I mean that they seem quite separate from any person, even from their author” (Hibbett, 417). Hibbett then writes that “[the quote] characterizes poetry as fragile—in danger of disappearing at the slightest intervention” (Hibbett, 417). This is precisely the anxiety which Hughes uses the jaguar in “Second Glance at a Jaguar” to write about. The animal in this piece is the animal of poetry. The kind of poetry represented by the jaguar is primal. It is primal and caged, caged externally—behind bars—and internally—beneath its own skin. For the purposes of this examination, the bars can be compared to the constraints of the classical approach to measuring meter in modern English poetry. The jaguar, or Hughes’ poetry, does not seek to be limited by the accentual syllabic foot. It’s something that Seamus Heaney noted in a 1979 interview:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hughes’ voice, I think, is in rebellion against a certain kind of demeaned, mannerly voice. It’s a voice that has no truck with irony because his dialect is not like that … I think Hughes’ great cry and call and bawl is that the English language and English poetry is longer and deeper and rougher than that … It’s a form of calling out for more …&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.ted-hughes.info/index.php?id=34&amp;amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=172&amp;amp;cHash=75ef9b2ceba0a1556e0d6af1db78e88c"&gt;Shapiro&lt;/a&gt;, 108)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the earlier poem, “The Jaguar,” Hughes writes about a group of caged animals in a zoo who are listlessly on display: “apes yawn,” tigers and lions are “fatigued with indolence,” and the boa constrictor “is a fossil” (Selected, 4). The patrons in the zoo, however, all “crowd” to witness the jaguar who “on a short fierce fuse” acts as if “there’s no cage to him” and “his stride is wildernesses of freedom” (Selected, 5). The first half of that poem is mostly hexametric and consists of iambs or trochees with a few substitutions while the second half is very irregular with clusters of strong stresses. The jaguar is a primal animal, and since Hughes is searching for that “rougher and deeper” primal urgency, his choice of the jaguar is purposeful. There is a “close symbolic relationship between the jaguar, social status, warfare, and the wielding of spiritual and political power by shamans and chiefs” in Central and South America (&lt;a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/124867"&gt;Saunders&lt;/a&gt;, 107). This becomes the setup of the later poem and an introduction to Hughes’ aesthetics which are deeply rooted in mythology. He uses “Second Glance at Jaguar” to extend this metaphor through imagery and concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Second Glance at a Jaguar” is a poem of transformation. There is the transformation in imagery of a pacing jaguar in a cage becoming a ceremonial Aztec warrior. There is the transformation in the alternating line lengths in the un-stanza’d couplets moving mostly from fewer stresses to more stresses to balance a ten stress unit. The language transforms; it mixes the origins of the English language with its Modern incarnation through musical and poetic devices. This poem is ultimately successful because it transforms, if interpreted in its own terms, the possibilities of how contemporary poetry can be read and written. This is only an excerpt from a longer paper. If you'd like to read that analysis of the poem, please e-mail me &lt;a href="mailto:kevin@kevindublin.com"&gt;poet[at]kevindublin.com&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href="http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/284" title="More on Hopkins"&gt;Gerard Manley Hopkins&lt;/a&gt; might teckevinally be considered a late Victorian poet, but formally he was so innovative that Ramazani, editor of (the amazing) &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Norton-Anthology-Modern-Contemporary-Poetry/dp/0393977919/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1364875505&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=Norton+Anthology+of+Modern+and+Contemporary+Poetry" title="When will there be a Kindle version?"&gt;Norton Anthology of Modern and Contemporary Poetry&lt;/a&gt; included him as a Modernist. I'd definitely agree, especially since his sprung rhythm, alliteration, and rhyming is more similar to rap lyrics than poetry. It's like Rakim said on his track "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkTUJ6FnFFQ" title="Listen"&gt;Follow the Leader&lt;/a&gt;:"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RAP is Rhythm And Poetry, cuts create sound effects /&lt;br&gt;
You might catch up if you follow the records he wrecks /&lt;br&gt;
Until then keep eating and swallowing /&lt;br&gt;
You better take a deep breath and keep following-- the leader. /&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rakim was just following Hopkins' tradition, and so are all the rappers (nearly every contemporary rapper) who followed him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Poetry, Video"></category><category term="Hopkins"></category><category term="Modern Monday"></category><category term="NPM"></category><category term="poetry"></category><category term="Rakim"></category><category term="Spring"></category></entry><entry><title>See Me on a Panel at the University of Southern California</title><link href="https://kevindublin.com/see-me-on-panel-at-usc.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-03-23T02:33:00-07:00</published><updated>2013-03-23T02:33:00-07:00</updated><author><name>kevin</name></author><id>tag:kevindublin.com,2013-03-23:/see-me-on-panel-at-usc.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I will be on a panel with two lovely and brilliant writers (Christopher Pendergraft and Dillon Scalzo) at the University of Southern California's Cruelty conference in Los Angeles, CA on April 12-13, 2013.

Printed books are a luxury. The rich (or moderately well-off) can have their books shipped or placed in storage; the old do not move their books; the young do not buy books, but they borrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With quality eBooks, I get the content I enjoy, and it’s cheaper, accessible faster, and all in one place. It’s not even just books. I send articles to my Kindle as documents via the web add-on, &lt;a href="http://www.readability.com/kevdublin/latest" title="Readibility"&gt;Readibility&lt;/a&gt;. It’s wonderful. As someone who doesn’t have a lot of money and who plans to move around a lot for (at least) the next five to seven years, eBooks just make sense. Amazon, your fully-integrated content system has done it. I’m a convert. Heck, I’m even going to start publishing chapbooks and books as eBooks via my micro press. Now, if only I could solve two problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I force publishers to embrace publishing more poetry as eBooks?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I get authors to sign my Kindle?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been at a reading showcasing new material and a person asks where they can buy the material they just heard? I have the solution. Have your work to sell before it’s published and still publish it later with PRE Press. I will produce chapbook-sized booklets for you up to 40 pages that you can take with you to conferences, workshops, and public reading events of course (open mics included). The best part about this service is that it’s not like a vanity press where your material is considered published. Once you run out of copies, it’s gone and you can still seek publication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Half Book&lt;/em&gt; (5.5×8.5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sixteen years ago today I read in a USA Today that Tupac Shakur had died. His work as an artist meant so much to me at such a young age, and his passion inspired me. The two greatest influences on my thoughts/perceptions/personal philosophies of the world up until my freshman year of college were Aristotle and Tupac. Growing up, I swore that one day I’d pick up where he left off— not necessarily as a rapper, but as someone who cared about his communities, his culture, his art, and who lived it passionately, giving everything. Now it’s 2012; sixteen years since his fight was over and I am now (barely, but still) at an age older than he ever lived to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Pac,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure I’ve fully lived up to that promise yet. I've done a bit, but I've not as Kevin Powell might say, “carried my weight.” I look around, and I see an America— a world— which isn't living up to its potential. Specifically, I see a Black American community (myself included) that’s not. Now I’m not trying to deify you or anything, but I think you were an important icon, an important person who had aspirations that weren't just your own. There were a few detours and decisions that probably weren't the best, but we all make mistakes. We must withhold judgment, and measure all men and women by their actions fully. I still respect your work; I’ll always respect your work. You are Hip-Hop. You are what hip-hop was; you are what hip-hop became; and for the foreseeable future, you are what hip-hop will be. You were subversive, multifaceted, passionate, proud, and despite what any naysayers might say, lyrical (feel free to challenge me in the comments; if it’s an intelligible comment, I’ll respond). Thank you for being a flame that burned bright. Thank you for showing me so much in your work and helping me to learn how to think critically, adding several perspectives to my world. Thank you for asking a lot of us. Thank you for helping me cope with my mother’s death. Thank you for helping me ask a lot of myself. Thank you for helping me believe in unconditional love. Thank you for helping me want to share my words with the world. Thank you for reminding me to keep my head up and take it one day at a time. Thank you for helping me believe that it’s all worth it. Thank you for the days I skated across sidewalks and asphalt confident-happy-rapping. Thank you for leaving a legacy. One day I’ll see you in heaven, and there won’t be any cracking concrete or broken bottles or used needles or shootings or dilapidated railroad tracks or abandoned buildings with cold hands inside trying to warm by a fire. No one will need to dream of escape or wanting more, and we can both be at peace knowing: one day, in their own ways, everyone will make it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
