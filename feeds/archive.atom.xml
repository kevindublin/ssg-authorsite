"Just like physical training, increasing our writing strength requires practice. Often, the more words put to page, the easier it becomes to put more there."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Writing Salon Monthly Meetup is designed to provide an intentional and facilitated space to help you keep a finger on your own creative pulse. At the same time, we provide the opportunity to engage with a community of other like-minded writers, including your own friends, neighbors, co-workers, and family members. Bringing a guest is encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silence your phone, leave your distractions at the door, and spend an hour and a half of your Sunday with The Writing Salon. Kevin will provide optional writing prompts and exercises, pre-writing activities, and more! Expect a fun and stress-free environment to play on the page and to mingle with other writers. The event is free, but donations are greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="archive"></category></entry><entry><title>Intro to Creative Writing in Berkeley @ Writing Salon</title><link href="https://kevindublin.com/intro-creative-writing-berkeley.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-08-30T10:14:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-08-30T10:14:00-07:00</updated><author><name>kevin</name></author><id>tag:kevindublin.com,2019-08-30:/intro-creative-writing-berkeley.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h4&gt;Intro to Creative Writing in Berkeley Class Description&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Everyone has a story, and every story is made up of other stories that can be told. So how will you tell your story? And to whom?" asks instructor &lt;a href="http://kevindublin.com/bio/"&gt;Kevin Dublin&lt;/a&gt; of the Berkeley creative writing class at the Writing Salon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a (5) week workshop that covers fiction, poetry, personal essay, and screenwriting. We will generate ideas and writing through a series of fun exercises. In class, we will build memorable scenes, create vivid images, hook with narration, craft characters, and develop engaging dialogue. A range of creative work from masters will guide us. Therefore, the work of Lydia Davis, Julio Cortazar, Morgan Parker, Matsuo Bashō, and Franz Kafka will make appearances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin says, "One key component of writing is finding people to talk with about writing who are as passionate as you are or would like to be. We'll provide a space for that."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though always optional,  there will be take-home exercises and opportunities to share your work with one another during class. By the end of five weeks, you’ll have the tools and confidence to write that poem, essay or story that’s all your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the name of poetic freedom, the Red Poets Society has been formed. Together we shall join weekly in the belly of Kafé Sobaka to celebrate all that is verse. Come all lyricists and crafters of the spoken word. Sally forth with your inklings and rhyme; share with your comrades the joy that is poetic expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rules: there are no rules but that which you pin upon your work, but seriously: each reader gets 5 uninterrupted (save for angry crowds) minutes to read their work; no music is allowed save as accompaniment to the reading; boring long winded pieces will be shunned appropriately; and stand-up comedy will not be tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also ask that you purchase either one drink or one food item in order to help maintain the sacred space. (See below.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realize that our intention is a collaboration of poets and critics and that verbal sass can and will be the only response to lyrical laziness and foolish ramblings. We want for your best and those striving to create difference and beauty with their work. We seek to offer a space in which to be both avant-garde and accepted, but also to be critiqued and honed into a better writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, each month as a special feature to the open mic session, a committee-elected featured performer shall woo the masses with their epic verse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open mic sign up starts at 6:30 p.m., the first performer speaks at 7 p.m. Eat, drink, be merry, verbalize! Skoal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-hosts: Tazha Williams &amp;amp; David Proulx&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starts at 7pm, sign up is at 6:30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No cover but there is a one drink or one food item minimum, which is facilitated with a \$5 RED TICKET:&lt;br&gt;
In order to simplify the chaos a bit, we will "sell" you a \$5 ticket at entry, which can be used for any drink (shot of vodka, beer, wine, Turkish coffee*, etc.) or as a \$5 credit for food. So plan to bring a few bucks for this purpose. Everything can be ordered at the counter and a number will be issued for delivery to your table (no wait service during the event).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="archive"></category></entry><entry><title>Poetry Ruckus</title><link href="https://kevindublin.com/poetry-ruckus-3.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-05-27T21:08:00-07:00</published><updated>2015-05-27T21:08:00-07:00</updated><author><name>kevin</name></author><id>tag:kevindublin.com,2015-05-27:/poetry-ruckus-3.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A monthly open mike event for local poets to share their work.

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday 5/27/15, Ruthless Hippies proudly presents the Poetry Ruckus at Ducky Waddle’s (414 N Coast Hwy 101 Leucadia) featuring guest poet Shannon Linzer!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shannon Linzer is a local San Diego poet whose work focuses on identity, privilege, queerness and religion. She is a regular in the San Diego open mic &amp;amp; slam scene, and has featured at Jhimye Poetry &amp;amp; Lyrical Exchange in North Park. Her work has been published in Spit Journal. When not writing, Shannon spends her time teaching all manner of things—English, exercise, handstands and cat tricks. Look for her daily haiku on facebook and her first short collection of poems, due out this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The artists’ books featured often push the form, employ a wide assortment of materials and methods of bookbinding, and explore varied subjects from the personal to the public.

&lt;p&gt;Chris Mosher started performing in 2002. Having grown up an artist and painter, he found his voice through a plethora of emerging vocalists, improvisers, and a small group of fellow rappers, musicians, and poets. Moving up and down the coast, recording and performing with friends and on his own, he has crafted a unique and lasting persona in both the spoken word and music scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shannon Perkins began performing in 2000 and quickly found herself on the San Diego Poetry Slam team the following year. As a part of multiple groups including Able Minded Poets and currently Ogd_s(11) Translation Has Failed, she has honed her craft as a performance poet. She has also shifted her attention toward visual art, featuring in galleries up and down the West Coast. Shannon was most recently featured on Ogd_s(11)’s album Falling Too Slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan Hubbard is one of San Diego’s busiest percussionists, leading several genre-pushing groups and collaborating with many of San Diego's finest. His five-volume album set, Encinitas and Everything After, was named Best Jazz Album at the San Diego Music Awards in October 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DJ Gill Sotu will also provide music. Sotu has opened for Grammy-nominated Sheila E, and partnered and performed with the San Diego Symphony. He has been commissioned to create numerous poetry pieces for the United Way of San Diego and performed for TEDx San Diego in December 2013. Sotu has been featured on NBC 7’s Art Pulse TV and was named the 2012 &amp;amp; 2013 San Diego RAW Performing Artist of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;

The reading will take place Wednesday, January 21st at 4:30 pm in the Visual Arts Performance Space (SME 149).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is FREE and open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Middleton is the author of the forthcoming Physics Envy (Chicago), a book about American poetry and science in the Cold War due to appear later in 2015. He is also the author of books on poetry and performance, a co-authored book on memory, and a study of masculinity, as well as many essays on modern poetry, and on literature and science, including climate change. He is currently the Secretary of the British Society for Literature and Science. Educated in both the United Kingdom and the United States, he is a Professor of English at the University of Southampton, UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What role does poetry play in public life? This question has led my research for many years. I have studied poetry performance, the gender politics of poetry, poetry as cultural memory, the role of little magazines, changing readerships, and most recently the interplay between poetry and science. Given the rigor required by scientific research, what possible use is a form of writing not grounded in exact knowledge other than as a cheerleader or critic on the sidelines? Recently I have been working with clinical researchers who are challenging the dogma that DNA is our medical fate. They are finding signs that the actions of the genes can be altered by environmental factors, alterations that may even last for generations. We appear to be on the verge of a new era of genetic medicine or epigenetics. Can poetry play any part in this? My talk explores the contribution that poetry can make to the wider public assessment of the linguistic, metaphorical, cultural, and ethical implications of such developments."&lt;/p&gt;
