&lt;p&gt;The second "Writing is Collaborative" newsletter went out today. What is that? Well, I'm used to sending out e-mails to writing friends about upcoming opportunities. I decided to turn it into a brief newsletter. And I did it because writing is about community. For instance, I like being a conduit. I want to share things with all of you. This is why I now send upcoming submission deadlines, residency opportunities, events, classes, writing prompts, and spotlights. You can subscribe below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can expect to find a lot of content and maybe a few musings. For example, I include a "video poem of the month." It's also specifically for writers, so I include a writing prompt. While it might be pretty poetry heave because I encounter a lot of poetry opportunities, it won't all be. I've included poetry, fiction, creative non-fiction, and playwriting opportunities thus far. I'll start including screenwriting and review opportunities in the next one. I also have friends from all kinds of backgrounds and in many locations, so everything might not apply to everyone. I included an opportunity that was only for Native Americans in the first one as well as some opportunities just for women, and others that have been for the LGBTQIA+ community. Of course, young and emerging writers are groups that I work with, so I'll include more of those in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a fun project! Send me your news, calls for submissions, and publications as well. I'd love to share!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Freebie, Opportunities"></category><category term="newsletter"></category><category term="writing is collaborative"></category></entry><entry><title>Free Crunchyroll Guest Pass</title><link href="https://kevindublin.com/free-crunchyroll-guest-pass.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-01-02T12:17:00-08:00</published><updated>2015-01-02T12:17:00-08:00</updated><author><name>kevin</name></author><id>tag:kevindublin.com,2015-01-02:/free-crunchyroll-guest-pass.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Remember: first come, first serve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a free Crunchyroll guest pass. You can watch licensed anime (legally) for free. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd highly recommend &lt;a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/kids-on-the-slope/episode-1-moanin-595623?p360=1"&gt;Kids on the Slope&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/attack-on-titan"&gt;Attack on Titan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/skip-beat"&gt;Skip Beat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I super recommend Kids on the Slope if you like Jazz music or Murakami's &lt;em&gt;Norwegian Wood&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you claim the code, please comment so people know that it's taken. Also be sure to follow me on Twitter &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/parteverything"&gt;\@parteverything&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note: I update the above link each time I get a free crunchyroll guest pass. This usually occurs every 30 days, but sometimes I get multiple passes. In which case, I post one here and share the other via my Twitter: \@parteverything. Again, I highly recommend Kids on the Slope. It's so understated and great!)&lt;/p&gt;
