"Just like physical training, increasing our writing strength requires practice. Often, the more words put to page, the easier it becomes to put more there."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Writing Salon Monthly Meetup is designed to provide an intentional and facilitated space to help you keep a finger on your own creative pulse. At the same time, we provide the opportunity to engage with a community of other like-minded writers, including your own friends, neighbors, co-workers, and family members. Bringing a guest is encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silence your phone, leave your distractions at the door, and spend an hour and a half of your Sunday with The Writing Salon. Kevin will provide optional writing prompts and exercises, pre-writing activities, and more! Expect a fun and stress-free environment to play on the page and to mingle with other writers.

&lt;p&gt;"Everyone has a story, and every story is made up of other stories that can be told. So how will you tell your story? And to whom?" asks instructor &lt;a href="http://kevindublin.com/bio/"&gt;Kevin Dublin&lt;/a&gt; of the Berkeley creative writing class at the Writing Salon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a (5) week workshop that covers fiction, poetry, personal essay, and screenwriting. We will generate ideas and writing through a series of fun exercises. In class, we will build memorable scenes, create vivid images, hook with narration, craft characters, and develop engaging dialogue. A range of creative work from masters will guide us. Therefore, the work of Lydia Davis, Julio Cortazar, Morgan Parker, Matsuo Bashō, and Franz Kafka will make appearances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin says, "One key component of writing is finding people to talk with about writing who are as passionate as you are or would like to be. We'll provide a space for that."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though always optional,  there will be take-home exercises and opportunities to share your work with one another during class. By the end of five weeks, you’ll have the tools and confidence to write that poem, essay or story that’s all your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Kevin Dublin [led] a special event for National Poetry Day at my place of work. That experience has stuck with me, in the best of ways! It was a completely new experience and opportunity for creative expression. Kevin also set a tone of comfort and nurtured a safe place for us to share what he had led us to create.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syzygy is about a block and a half from Powell Street Station and directly across the street from the bar Aunt Charlie's. The door will be black with an ajar gate in front of it. Press the doorbell to be let in.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Subscribe to Newsletter</title><link href="https://kevindublin.com/subscribe-to-newsletter.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-04-05T13:42:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-04-05T13:42:00-07:00</updated><author><name>kevin</name></author><id>tag:kevindublin.com,2019-04-05:/subscribe-to-newsletter.html</id><content type="html"></content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title></title><link href="https://kevindublin.com/100707.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-02-11T02:15:00-08:00</published><updated>2019-02-11T02:15:00-08:00</updated><author><name>kevin</name></author><id>tag:kevindublin.com,2019-02-11:/100707.html</id><content type="html"></content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Generative Poetry Workshop San Francisco</title><link href="https://kevindublin.com/poetry-workshop-sf-syzygy.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-02-11T02:05:00-08:00</published><updated>2019-02-11T02:05:00-08:00</updated><author><name>kevin</name></author><id>tag:kevindublin.com,2019-02-11:/poetry-workshop-sf-syzygy.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Come to this Generative Poetry Workshop in SF led by Kevin Dublin to go through a series of short prompts.

&lt;h4&gt;What&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marvel versus DC is an unlicensed 2 - 4 player game that I created with my son, Darien Dublin, in the summer of 2014.  One of my favorite board games is Star Wars: Epic Duels. He really wanted to play with me, but he was six years old. Each character has a deck of 40 cards in that game. He could read, but it was a little to advanced for him. My goal was to make a game with him that he could play an utilized one of our favorite shared interests: superheroes. Who doesn't want to see those heroes battle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e8K1m6SCRz4" width="1349" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;How&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took the base mechanics of Star Wars: Epic Duels as inspiration and simplified the mechanics for the Marvel versus DC game. We had six 2.5 inch DC  PVC figures from Dollar Tree that we had been playing with. We had my childhood Marvel die-cast collection from the "Steel Mutants" and "Heavy Metal Heroes" series of the 90's. The only other things we had were our imaginations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3284/star-wars-epic-duels"&gt;&lt;img alt="star-wars-epic-duels" class="aligncenter wp-image-100682 size-full" height="600" src="http://kevindublin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Epic-Duels.jpg" width="896"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Over the course of the weekend, I wrote a series of rules. He picked who the first ten characters would be, and we discussed which powers should be showcased in their cards. We also watched old episodes of Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes on Netflix. After some math that I no longer remember, I came up with the size of the board, drew a set of squares for a map in Photoshop, and we had our first game board after a lot of printing &amp;amp; cutting &amp;amp; taping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't own these characters, nor the art used for the cards, but we worked really hard on the mechanics. My dream is to use the mechanics along with a set of original characters that we create and develop our own Heroes versus Villains universe in a game. Until then, we thought you might enjoy downloading and playing along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Marvel versus DC game has grown a lot. We have balanced and re-balanced it. It has brought a lot of joy. We've shared it with family, friends, and strangers at game shops / comic-cons. In other words, give it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Where to Buy Figures&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have (50) characters now. We teckevinally have more figures, but I decided to stop there because that already seemed like too many. Start low, with 6 - 10 characters and build from there. We use figures that are between 2.5 inches to 3 inches. You can probably go to Dollar Tree and buy the Justice League figures there: Batman, Flash, Green Lantern, and Superman along with the Joker. You can find others on Amazon, eBay, comic book stores and booths at conventions. If you don't mind the size, you can also buy Nano MetalFigs at your local Wal-Mart. They are about 1.5 inches and the game wasn't made with those in mind. &lt;a href="https://www.monogramdirect.com/products-by-license/dc-comics/diorama-figures/diorama-figures.html"&gt;Monogram International&lt;/a&gt; produced a lot of the 2.75 inch DC figures. Tips: search with the keywords "cake topper," "pvc 2.75," and "die cast 90s Marvel."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007EYK1DG?"&gt;Thor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Fall in Love in San Diego (&lt;/em&gt;Finishing Line Press, June 2017&lt;em&gt;) &lt;/em&gt;is a chapbook of 26 love &amp;amp; anti-love poems. The poems live inside, around, and far outside the bounds of San Diego, CA. They serve as a collective attempt to encapsulate the city’s energy and people as well as the universal, sometimes heart-wrenching 21st century search for love or something similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Reviews&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kevin Dublin is a new poet whose open-hearted songs of praise remind me of Whitman, O’Hara, and Ross Gay. &lt;em&gt;How to Fall in Love in San Diego&lt;/em&gt; is a collection of remarkable formal variety, encompassing received forms, nonce forms, and what feels like a truly original improvisatory style with grace and confidence. It is also a collection of tonal and even spiritual variety. It can be as giddy and inclusive as one of the &lt;em&gt;Lunch Poems&lt;/em&gt;, as forcefully engaged with the world as &lt;em&gt;Citizen&lt;/em&gt;, or as transcendent and magisterial as Wordsworth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;even as the world beyond ashes and burns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May we wake each morning and remember it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to more from this wonderful poet. In &lt;em&gt;How to Fall in Love in San Diego&lt;/em&gt;, Dublin develops a redemptive art that charms even as it restores us to our own better selves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href="http://www.michaelwhitepoet.com/"&gt;Michael White&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;em&gt;Travels in Vermeer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kevin Dublin’s &lt;em&gt;How to Fall in Love in San Diego&lt;/em&gt; is synaptic, prowling dangerous borderlands between our nearly inarticulate sorrows and the ineffable.  These poems commune with desire and desertion, limn betrayal and tally up the damage.  The epiphanies are nearly numinous: “&lt;em&gt;Goodbye &lt;/em&gt;reminds me / to &lt;em&gt;mean what you put your mouth on&lt;/em&gt; / whether it’s words or the silent parts of a body.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.connotationpress.com/hoppenthaler-s-congeries"&gt;John Hoppenthaler&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;em&gt;Domestic Garden&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Dublin’s debut has some of the most beautiful love poems I have read this year, which is to say these are poems of heart-break and the knowledge that comes after, poems of play and the excitement that comes with, poems of surprise and the astonishment that stays. “Pretend you are here / for a wedding” the poet tells us, “—unless you are here for a wedding.” There is so much fun in these pages that you know pain is real. There is so much feeling in the images, in the tonalities, in the sexiness of warning (“that attraction transcends most sanity”), in lips (“each a strawberry perfectly split open”), in silences (“when a lover sleep-rhymes words that don’t rhyme”), in dreams (“that teach carousels are the best place for orgasms”). Beware. These poems bewitch. You might just fall in love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat—right in the grass. Where the hours pulled&lt;br&gt;
themselves onto my lap and asked to be cradled.&lt;br&gt;
Silent as the oval of my mouth when you said&lt;br&gt;
you wanted to be pregnant at a car dealership&lt;br&gt;
during an argument about curly fries &amp;amp; condiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will become of our children? They will suffer&lt;br&gt;
the rough edge of tenderness from another father,&lt;br&gt;
another mother. Your goodbye is an earthquake.&lt;br&gt;
The rest of life aftershocks at the realization: we were&lt;br&gt;
tectonic &amp;amp; unaware with no promise of tremors’ stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am afraid you will remember me as a wooden ladder&lt;br&gt;
or even worse, forget I was. And I’ll remember you&lt;br&gt;
as a disaster. Unable to recall how you swallowed yawns&lt;br&gt;
like milk, the attractiveness of how slow you’d waddle—&lt;br&gt;
so slow I’d miss your step—dust collected on magenta toes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we met, we were incredibly far from the desert.&lt;br&gt;
I thought you were too good for me. I didn’t think&lt;br&gt;
you’d speak. You said there’s a delay in my handsomeness.&lt;br&gt;
The &lt;em&gt;ness&lt;/em&gt; unsteadily climbed from your tongue to lips.&lt;br&gt;
I watched it fog, pillow in the air—brace a snowflake’s fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Fall in Love in San Diego&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple cuddles tongues on the corner of 5th and Market&lt;br&gt;
Their meeting shades sunrays that heat the rain puddle&lt;br&gt;
A man waits to wash his hands in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not Kissing You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As inconvenient as being&lt;br&gt;
the mother of breeze—&lt;br&gt;
How she must name&lt;br&gt;
each breeze and remember it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which one stirs empty chip wrapper&lt;br&gt;
saddling the curb near your sandal?&lt;br&gt;
I rub my cheek to be less conscious of air&lt;br&gt;
untidying the hair on my forearms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the slight stutter of your smile—&lt;br&gt;
Glow of November dusk across brow&lt;br&gt;
while trolley brakes against rails in the distance.&lt;br&gt;
Your lips: a strawberry perfectly split open.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title></title><link href="https://kevindublin.com/100556.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-01-20T04:45:00-08:00</published><updated>2017-01-20T04:45:00-08:00</updated><author><name>kevin</name></author><id>tag:kevindublin.com,2017-01-20:/100556.html</id><content type="html"></content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>How to Fall in Love in San Diego</title><link href="https://kevindublin.com/how-to-fall.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-01-19T09:34:00-08:00</published><updated>2017-01-19T09:34:00-08:00</updated><author><name>kevin</name></author><id>tag:kevindublin.com,2017-01-19:/how-to-fall.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Fall in Love in San Diego (&lt;/em&gt;Finishing Line Press, May 2017&lt;em&gt;) &lt;/em&gt;is a chapbook of 26 love &amp;amp; anti-love poems.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise for &lt;em&gt;How to Fall in Love in San Diego&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kevin Dublin is a new poet whose open-hearted songs of praise remind me of Whitman, O’Hara, and Ross Gay. &lt;em&gt;How to Fall in Love in San Diego&lt;/em&gt; is a collection of remarkable formal variety, encompassing received forms, nonce forms, and what feels like a truly original improvisatory style with grace and confidence. It is also a collection of tonal and even spiritual variety: it can be as giddy and inclusive as one of the &lt;em&gt;Lunch Poems&lt;/em&gt;, as forcefully engaged with the world as &lt;em&gt;Citizen&lt;/em&gt;, or as transcendent and magisterial as Wordsworth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;even as the world beyond ashes and burns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May we wake each morning and remember it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to more from this wonderful poet. In &lt;em&gt;How to Fall in Love in San Diego&lt;/em&gt;, Dublin develops a redemptive art that charms even as it restores us to our own better selves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--&lt;a href="http://www.michaelwhitepoet.com/"&gt;Michael White&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;em&gt;Travels in Vermeer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kevin Dublin’s &lt;em&gt;How to Fall in Love in San Diego&lt;/em&gt; is synaptic, prowling dangerous borderlands between our nearly inarticulate sorrows and the ineffable.  These poems commune with desire and desertion, limn betrayal and tally up the damage.  The epiphanies are nearly numinous: “&lt;em&gt;Goodbye &lt;/em&gt;reminds me / to &lt;em&gt;mean what you put your mouth on&lt;/em&gt; / whether it’s words or the silent parts of a body.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--&lt;a href="https://www.connotationpress.com/hoppenthaler-s-congeries"&gt;John Hoppenthaler&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;em&gt;Domestic Garden&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Dublin’s debut has some of the most beautiful love poems I have read this year, which is to say these are poems of heart-break and the knowledge that comes after, poems of play and the excitement that comes with, poems of surprise and the astonishment that stays. “Pretend you are here / for a wedding” the poet tells us, “—unless you are here for a wedding.” There is so much fun in these pages that you know pain is real, there is so much feeling in the images, in the tonalities, in the sexiness of warning (that attraction transcends most sanity), in lips (each a strawberry perfectly split open), in silences (when a lover sleep-rhymes words that don’t rhyme), in dreams (that teach carousels are the best place for orgasms). Beware. These poems bewitch. You might just fall in love.&lt;/p&gt;

El Poeta tells the story of renowned Mexican poet Javier Sicilia, who ignited mass protests and an ongoing international movement after the brutal killing of his 24-year-old son Juan Francisco in 2011 -- collateral damage in a drug war that has left more than 100,000 dead or missing since 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the name of poetic freedom, the Red Poets Society has been formed. Together we shall join weekly in the belly of Kafé Sobaka to celebrate all that is verse. Come all lyricists and crafters of the spoken word. Sally forth with your inklings and rhyme; share with your comrades the joy that is poetic expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rules: there are no rules but that which you pin upon your work, but seriously: each reader gets 5 uninterrupted (save for angry crowds) minutes to read their work; no music is allowed save as accompaniment to the reading; boring long winded pieces will be shunned appropriately; and stand-up comedy will not be tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also ask that you purchase either one drink or one food item in order to help maintain the sacred space. (See below.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realize that our intention is a collaboration of poets and critics and that verbal sass can and will be the only response to lyrical laziness and foolish ramblings. We want for your best and those striving to create difference and beauty with their work. We seek to offer a space in which to be both avant-garde and accepted, but also to be critiqued and honed into a better writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, each month as a special feature to the open mic session, a committee-elected featured performer shall woo the masses with their epic verse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open mic sign up starts at 6:30 p.m., the first performer speaks at 7 p.m. Eat, drink, be merry, verbalize! Skoal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-hosts: Tazha Williams &amp;amp; David Proulx&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starts at 7pm, sign up is at 6:30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No cover but there is a one drink or one food item minimum, which is facilitated with a \$5 RED TICKET:&lt;br&gt;
In order to simplify the chaos a bit, we will "sell" you a \$5 ticket at entry, which can be used for any drink (shot of vodka, beer, wine, Turkish coffee*, etc.) or as a \$5 credit for food. So plan to bring a few bucks for this purpose. Everything can be ordered at the counter and a number will be issued for delivery to your table (no wait service during the event).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Steve's Poetry &amp; Prose Open Mic</title><link href="https://kevindublin.com/steves-poetry-prose-open-mic.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-05-28T21:08:00-07:00</published><updated>2015-05-28T21:08:00-07:00</updated><author><name>kevin</name></author><id>tag:kevindublin.com,2015-05-28:/steves-poetry-prose-open-mic.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Second and fourth Sundays.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday 5/27/15, Ruthless Hippies proudly presents the Poetry Ruckus at Ducky Waddle’s (414 N Coast Hwy 101 Leucadia) featuring guest poet Shannon Linzer!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shannon Linzer is a local San Diego poet whose work focuses on identity, privilege, queerness and religion. She is a regular in the San Diego open mic &amp;amp; slam scene, and has featured at Jhimye Poetry &amp;amp; Lyrical Exchange in North Park. Her work has been published in Spit Journal. When not writing, Shannon spends her time teaching all manner of things—English, exercise, handstands and cat tricks. Look for her daily haiku on facebook and her first short collection of poems, due out this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freedom Writers. 2007. 123 minutes. PG-13. An idealistic high school English teacher (Hillary Swank) quickly learns that her students have more to worry about than homework -- her students go home everyday to gunfire, gangs, drugs, and a host of other difficult situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She challenges her students to read The Diary of Anne Frank and Zlata's Diary: A Child's Life in Saravejo and to write in their own diaries about the violence, discrimination, and hatred that is part of their everyday lives. The film is based onThe Freedom Writers Diary, the 1999 non-fiction book written by students at Woodrow Wilson High School in Long Beach, California and their teacher Erin Gruwell.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Gelato Poetry Series</title><link href="https://kevindublin.com/gelato-poetry-series.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-04-11T18:08:00-07:00</published><updated>2015-04-11T18:08:00-07:00</updated><author><name>kevin</name></author><id>tag:kevindublin.com,2015-04-11:/gelato-poetry-series.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;2nd Fridays.

In 25 years of collecting, the Athenaeum artists’ book collection has grown into an important resource for artists, researchers, and presses. While portions of the collection are continually displayed for visitors in the Athenaeum’s North Reading Room and are also available for use by appointment, this exhibition provides unprecedented access to over 50 books by 36 local artists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The artists’ books featured often push the form, employ a wide assortment of materials and methods of bookbinding, and explore varied subjects from the personal to the public. Through the outstanding collection of the Athenaeum, [UN]BOUND offers a unique opportunity to discover the book as both object and idea in the hands of San Diego artists.&lt;/p&gt;

People’s Choice Poem Awards follow the performances. This interactive arts and culture experience will include wine, snacks and plenty of time to mingle. Doors open at 6:30 p.m. and the show starts at 7 p.m. Members are free, nonmembers are \$5 at the door, or bring wine to share and get in free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Mosher started performing in 2002. Having grown up an artist and painter, he found his voice through a plethora of emerging vocalists, improvisers, and a small group of fellow rappers, musicians, and poets. Moving up and down the coast, recording and performing with friends and on his own, he has crafted a unique and lasting persona in both the spoken word and music scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shannon Perkins began performing in 2000 and quickly found herself on the San Diego Poetry Slam team the following year. As a part of multiple groups including Able Minded Poets and currently Ogd_s(11) Translation Has Failed, she has honed her craft as a performance poet. She has also shifted her attention toward visual art, featuring in galleries up and down the West Coast. Shannon was most recently featured on Ogd_s(11)’s album Falling Too Slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan Hubbard is one of San Diego’s busiest percussionists, leading several genre-pushing groups and collaborating with many of San Diego's finest. His five-volume album set, Encinitas and Everything After, was named Best Jazz Album at the San Diego Music Awards in October 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DJ Gill Sotu will also provide music. Sotu has opened for Grammy-nominated Sheila E, and partnered and performed with the San Diego Symphony. He has been commissioned to create numerous poetry pieces for the United Way of San Diego and performed for TEDx San Diego in December 2013. Sotu has been featured on NBC 7’s Art Pulse TV and was named the 2012 &amp;amp; 2013 San Diego RAW Performing Artist of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The People’s Choice Poem Performance Award – All participants read/perform one poem under three minutes long. Audience members choose (by secret ballot) their favorite poem based on content and performance. Props, artwork, singing, music, dancing, all accompaniment is allowed and anything goes. Top poem performances (the poems that receive the most votes) win \$50. Audience members will be encouraged to hoot for their favorites and try to influence the rest of the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writers/artists who would like to participate in the People’s Choice Poem Performance Awards can get their names in the hat ahead of time at mkklam\@gmail.com or sign in on the night of the show.&lt;/p&gt;

The reading will take place Wednesday, January 21st at 4:30 pm in the Visual Arts Performance Space (SME 149).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is FREE and open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Middleton is the author of the forthcoming Physics Envy (Chicago), a book about American poetry and science in the Cold War due to appear later in 2015. He is also the author of books on poetry and performance, a co-authored book on memory, and a study of masculinity, as well as many essays on modern poetry, and on literature and science, including climate change. He is currently the Secretary of the British Society for Literature and Science. Educated in both the United Kingdom and the United States, he is a Professor of English at the University of Southampton, UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What role does poetry play in public life? This question has led my research for many years. I have studied poetry performance, the gender politics of poetry, poetry as cultural memory, the role of little magazines, changing readerships, and most recently the interplay between poetry and science. Given the rigor required by scientific research, what possible use is a form of writing not grounded in exact knowledge other than as a cheerleader or critic on the sidelines? Recently I have been working with clinical researchers who are challenging the dogma that DNA is our medical fate. They are finding signs that the actions of the genes can be altered by environmental factors, alterations that may even last for generations. We appear to be on the verge of a new era of genetic medicine or epigenetics. Can poetry play any part in this? My talk explores the contribution that poetry can make to the wider public assessment of the linguistic, metaphorical, cultural, and ethical implications of such developments."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time in Los Angeles, Yesika Salgado was born to Salvadorian immigrants. As a direct result of too many library visits, telenovelas and a large passionate family, she developed a torrid love affair with Poetry. She writes about many different things but always from the perspective of a fat brown girl loving and living in two cultures simultaneously.&lt;br&gt;
Yesika has shared her work at schools and venues throughout Southern California. In July of 2013 she published her first collection of poetry titled The Luna Poems and is a member of the 2014 Da Poetry Lounge Slam Team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about her follow her on twitter: \@yesikastarr&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM: What would you name the autobiography of your life?&lt;br&gt;
YS: Corazon. I’ve had the titled chosen for years. It means heart. It is also used the same way the word Darling is used in the English language. It’s what my father called my sisters and I. It is my favorite thing to be called.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM: If you could dis-invent one thing, what would it be?&lt;br&gt;
YS: Guns. I’d settle for guns that belong to racist cops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM: What is your favorite movie line or scene?&lt;br&gt;
YS: My favorite movie scene has no dialogue. It is from the movie Amelie. The man she is in love with walks into the diner she works at. He sits down. She never musters up the courage to talk to him. When he gets up to leave she looks at him one last time and suddenly becomes a puddle of water. It is so beautiful. It is exactly how those kind of moments feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM: What was the first thing you bought with your own money?&lt;br&gt;
YS: I bought a Nokia brick cell phone with my first paycheck and I played snake on it for hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM: If you could bring someone famous back from the grave (not as a zombie), who would you choose?&lt;br&gt;
YS: Charles Bukowski aka Bae aka my beloved. If I could pick a second person it will be Selena. You know what, Selena wins over Bukowski. I pick Selena. That brown girl gave me life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM: If you could learn to do anything, what would it be?&lt;br&gt;
YS: How to spin straw into gold. Haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come through as this Thursday's open mic puts 2014 in the books for Glassless Minds!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

The best part about this service is that it’s not like a vanity press where your material is considered published. Once you run out of copies, it’s gone and you can still seek publication.&lt;/p&gt;
